"A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services."
"I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me."

"I dared, I conquered them all, till now I have sold myself to death, with the sole condition that thou shouldst follow me Fire, and war, and plague, unite for thy destruction O my Raymond, there is no safety for thee"" With an heavy heart I listened to the changes of her delirium; I made her a bed of cloaks; her violence decreased and a clammy dew stood on her brow as the paleness of death succeeded to the crimson of fever, I placed her on the cloaks."
The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.

"To be near him, to be loved by him, to feel him again her own, was the limit of her desires."
"The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered."
"All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies."
"The ex queen gives me Idris; Adrian is totally unfitted to succeed to the earldom, and that earldom in my hands becomes a kingdom."

"He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation."
"I had expected some extravagant proposition, and remained silent awhile, collecting my thoughts that I might the better combat her fanciful scheme."
"They still appeared in public together, and lived under the same roof."
"He began to answer with violence: ""Yes, yes, I hate you You are my bane, my poison, my disgust Oh No"" And then his manner changed, and fixing his eyes on me with an expression that convulsed every nerve and member of my frame ""you are none of all these; you are my light, my only one, my life."
"Besides, Perdita was with him in his retirement; she saw the moodiness that succeeded to this forced hilarity; she marked his disturbed sleep, his painful irritability once she had seen his tears hers had scarce ceased to flow, since she had beheld the big drops which disappointed pride had caused to gather in his eye, but which pride was unable to dispel."
"I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland."
My skin was embrowned by the sun; my step was firm with conscious power.
"I started forward and exclaimed, ""Villain Before you sign my death warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe."""
"He determined to extract and condense all of glory, power, and achievement, which might have resulted from a long reign, into the three years of his Protectorate."
"They had received orders that if I were again taken, I should be brought to the Earl; and his lenity made them expect a conclusion which they considered ill befitting my crime."
"Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt."
"I had now spent many hours in tears and mournful meditation; it was past twelve o'clock; all was at peace in the house, and the gentle air that stole in at my window did not rustle the leaves of the twining plants that shadowed it."
"Look, I weep: for more than two years I have never enjoyed one moment free from anguish."
Justine was called on for her defence.
My words flowed spontaneously my utterance was firm and quick.
"He obeyed her injunctions, and passed a year in exile in Cumberland."
"He reverted to his past life, his successes in Greece, his favour at home."
"I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more."
Horrible sights were shaped to me in the turbid cloud that hovered over the city; and my only relief was derived from the struggles I made to approach the gate.
"I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible."
I will protect the first the latter I commit to your charge.

"He was full of thought, and remained silent during a considerable part of our ride; at length he said, ""I must apologize to you for my abstraction; the truth is, Ryland's motion comes on to night, and I am considering my reply."""
"Raymond did not wonder, that, thus situated, the artist had shrunk from notice, but he did not for this alter his resolve."
"But while I endured punishment and pain in their defence with the spirit of an hero, I claimed as my reward their praise and obedience."
I must collect my thoughts.

"""Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably."""
"They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country."

"If manly courage and resistance can save us, we will be saved."
"The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love."
I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.
"I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being."
"Adrian had introduced systematic modes of proceeding in the metropolis, which, while they were unable to stop the progress of death, yet prevented other evils, vice and folly, from rendering the awful fate of the hour still more tremendous."
"The extreme darkness of the stage, whose only light was received from the fire under the cauldron, joined to a kind of mist that floated about it, rendered the unearthly shapes of the witches obscure and shadowy."
"For a long time I dared not hope; but when his unobstructed breathing and the moisture that suffused his forehead, were tokens no longer to be mistaken of the departure of mortal malady, I ventured to whisper the news of the change to Idris, and at length succeeded in persuading her that I spoke truth."
"My first thought was Perdita; to her I must return; her I must support, drawing such food from despair as might best sustain her wounded heart; recalling her from the wild excesses of grief, by the austere laws of duty, and the soft tenderness of regret."
"He owned affinity not only with mankind, but all nature was akin to him; the mountains and sky were his friends; the winds of heaven and the offspring of earth his playmates; while he the focus only of this mighty mirror, felt his life mingle with the universe of existence."
"Alfred stood immoveable before him, his whole attention absorbed."
"Leave me; I am inexorable."""
I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.

"She might have heard of my return from London, and my visit to Bolter's Lock, which, connected with my continued absence, might tend greatly to alarm her."
"This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence."
"We found, on each side of the humid pathway, ""dry land for the sole of the foot."""
"I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion."
"Since then I must be an object of indifference or contempt to her, better, far better avoid her, nor expose myself before her and the scornful world to the chance of playing the mad game of a fond, foolish Icarus."
I shewed her the dangers which her children incurred during her absence; and she at length agreed not to go beyond the inclosure of the forest.
"The remains of the half finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being."
Then again the kindly influence ceased to act I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.
"His feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties."
"""The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin."
"""My children,"" she said, ""my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union."
"I will win him to me; he shall not deny his grief to me and when I know his secret then will I pour a balm into his soul and again I shall enjoy the ravishing delight of beholding his smile, and of again seeing his eyes beam if not with pleasure at least with gentle love and thankfulness."
I soon arrived at the hut: the door was ajar.
For a moment I was almost paralized by fear; but my energy returned and I demanded a guide to accompany me in following his steps.
I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.
I remembered in one of her harshest moments a quotation of mine had roused her to anger and disdain.
"About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship."

I will not dwell longer than I need on these disastrous circumstances.
I heard the next morning from the steward that upon his arrival he had been in a most terrible state of mind: he had passed the first night in the garden lying on the damp grass; he did not sleep but groaned perpetually.
"Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible."
I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.
"As the music went on, my ideas seemed to quit their mortal dwelling house; they shook their pinions and began a flight, sailing on the placid current of thought, filling the creation with new glory, and rousing sublime imagery that else had slept voiceless."
"I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate."
"One fine February day, when the sun had reassumed some of its genial power, I walked in the forest with my family."
At this time Lord Raymond returned from Greece.
"Bread and water did not tame my blood, nor solitary confinement inspire me with gentle thoughts."
"I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity."
The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.
Alas Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.
I was struck by the improvement that appeared in the health of Adrian.
"""Are you better now, sir?"" said she."
Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.
"His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me."
"I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me."

"Their still apparent union permitted her to do much; but no woman could, in the end, present a remedy to the encreasing negligence of the Protector; who, as if seized with a paroxysm of insanity, trampled on all ceremony, all order, all duty, and gave himself up to license."
The rooks cawed loudly in the trees above; mixed with their hoarse cries I heard a lively strain of music.
No sympathy may I ever find.
"I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, ""Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness."
"As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found."
"Elinor die This is frenzy and the most miserable despair: you cannot die while I am near."""
"Our talk was on subjects, unconnected with the emotions that evidently occupied each; but we each divined the other's thought, and as our voices spoke of indifferent matters, our eyes, in mute language, told a thousand things no tongue could have uttered."
Nor did Adrian instruct me only in the cold truths of history and philosophy.
"'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster Ugly wretch You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces."
"In the open air alone I found relief; among nature's beauteous works, her God reassumed his attribute of benevolence, and again I could trust that he who built up the mountains, planted the forests, and poured out the rivers, would erect another state for lost humanity, where we might awaken again to our affections, our happiness, and our faith."
"""Vase am I,"" she thought, ""vase brimful of despair's direst essence."
"He alluded to Adrian, and spoke of him with that disparagement that the worldly wise always attach to enthusiasm."
I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.
"Raymond had evidently vacillated during his journey, and irresolution was marked in every gesture as we entered Perdita's cottage."
"When my father had arrived the storm had already begun, but he had refused to stop and leaving his horse there he walked on towards the sea."
"Alas, what will become of us?"
"""The relatives of the Earl of Windsor,"" said she haughtily, ""doubtless think that I injured him; perhaps the Earl himself would be the first to acquit me, but probably I do not deserve acquittal."
His demeanour was sad; for a moment he appeared glad to see me and then he checked himself as if unwilling to betray his feelings.
"The wound, and consequent inability of Argyropylo, caused Raymond to be the first in command."
"I often wished that I had permitted her to take her own course, and engage herself in such labours for the welfare of others as might have distracted her thoughts."

"She reposed beside her beloved, and the tomb above was inscribed with the united names of Raymond and Perdita."
"Her story was plain to him, plain and distinct as the remorse and horror that darted their fangs into him."
If I wept he would gaze on me in silence but he was no longer harsh and although he repulsed every caress yet it was with gentleness.
"These sounds were mingled with the roaring of the sea, the splash of the chafed billows round the vessel's sides, and the gurgling up of the water in the hold."
"But I could discover, amidst all her repinings, deep resentment towards Raymond, and an unfading sense of injury, that plucked from me my hope, when I appeared nearest to its fulfilment."
"He rode through the town, visiting the wounded, and giving such orders as were necessary for the siege he meditated."
"This was not altogether the fact: but predominant self will assumed the arms and masque of callous feeling; and the haughty lady disdained to exhibit any token of the struggle she endured; while the slave of pride, she fancied that she sacrificed her happiness to immutable principle."
"I was now in Holborn, and passed by a public house filled with uproarious companions, whose songs, laughter, and shouts were more sorrowful than the pale looks and silence of the mourner."
"I rambled on, oppressed, distracted by painful emotions suddenly I found myself before Drury Lane Theatre."
"Excellent friend how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own."
"While in London these and many other dreadful thoughts too harrowing for words were my portion: I lost all this suffering when I was free; when I saw the wild heath around me, and the evening star in the west, then I could weep, gently weep, and be at peace."
"""What can I do?"" she cried, ""I am lost we are both for ever lost But come come with me, Lionel; here I must not stay, we can get a chaise at the nearest post house; yet perhaps we have time come, O come with me to save and protect me"" When I heard her piteous demands, while with disordered dress, dishevelled hair, and aghast looks, she wrung her hands the idea shot across me is she also mad? ""Sweet one,"" and I folded her to my heart, ""better repose than wander further; rest my beloved, I will make a fire you are chill."""
"My productions however were sufficiently unpretending; they were confined to the biography of favourite historical characters, especially those whom I believed to have been traduced, or about whom clung obscurity and doubt."
But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.
"She received these tokens of returning love with gentleness; she did not shun his company; but she endeavoured to place a barrier in the way of familiar intercourse or painful discussion, which mingled pride and shame prevented Raymond from surmounting."
"Here were the future governors of England; the men, who, when our ardour was cold, and our projects completed or destroyed for ever, when, our drama acted, we doffed the garb of the hour, and assumed the uniform of age, or of more equalizing death; here were the beings who were to carry on the vast machine of society; here were the lovers, husbands, fathers; here the landlord, the politician, the soldier; some fancied that they were even now ready to appear on the stage, eager to make one among the dramatis personae of active life."
"Evadne, once the idol of Adrian's affections; and who, for the sake of her present visitor, had disdained the noble youth, and then, neglected by him she loved, with crushed hopes and a stinging sense of misery, had returned to her native Greece."
"But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition."
"But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust."
"Great God If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage."
"In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me."
"Such a monster has, then, really existence I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration."
It is hard for one so young who was once so happy as I was; sic voluntarily to divest themselves of all sensation and to go alone to the dreary grave; I dare not.
"In her resentful mood, these expressions had been remembered with acrimony and disdain; they visited her in her softened hour, taking sleep from her eyes, all hope of rest from her uneasy mind."
God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.
"Give me the name of friend; I will fulfill its duties; and if for a moment complaint and sorrow would shape themselves into words let me be near to speak peace to your vext soul."""
Her manners were cold and repulsive.
"She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt."

He was nearly killed with kindness.
"I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours."
"I have consorted long with grief, entered the gloomy labyrinth of madness, and emerged, but half alive."
"My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path."
"Some reflection seemed to sting him, and the spasm of pain that for a moment convulsed his countenance, checked my indignation."
"The chamber was full but there was no Protector; and there was an austere discontent manifest on the countenances of the leaders, and a whispering and busy tattle among the underlings, not less ominous."
"Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears."
"The landlady met her in the passage; the poor creature asked, ""Is my husband here?"

Often with maternal affection she had figured their merits and talents exerted on life's wide stage.
Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.
"I alighted at Perth; and, though much fatigued by a constant exposure to the air for many hours, I would not rest, but merely altering my mode of conveyance, I went by land instead of air, to Dunkeld."
"Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world."
"I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom."
I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.
"I was weary with watching and for some time I had combated with the heavy sleep that weighed down my eyelids: but now, no longer fearful, I threw myself on my bed."

"In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life."
"No one ventured on board the vessel, and strange sights were averred to be seen at night, walking the deck, and hanging on the masts and shrouds."
I must not forget one incident that occurred during this visit to London.
We have forgotten what we did when she was not.
"I collected bones from charnel houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame."
"This burst of passionate feeling over, with calmed thoughts we sat together, talking of the past and present."

Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.
"The light curling waves bore us onward, and old ocean smiled at the freight of love and hope committed to his charge; it stroked gently its tempestuous plains, and the path was smoothed for us."
The Countess had failed in this design with regard to her children; perhaps she hoped to find the next remove in birth more tractable.

"Then again she sadly lamented her hard fate; that a woman, with a woman's heart and sensibility, should be driven by hopeless love and vacant hopes to take up the trade of arms, and suffer beyond the endurance of man privation, labour, and pain the while her dry, hot hand pressed mine, and her brow and lips burned with consuming fire."
"She had gone to hide her weakness; escaping from the castle, she had descended to the little park, and sought solitude, that she might there indulge her tears; I found her clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk with her roseate lips, as her tears fell plenteously, and her sobs and broken exclamations could not be suppressed; with surpassing grief I beheld this loved one of my heart thus lost in sorrow I drew her towards me; and, as she felt my kisses on her eyelids, as she felt my arms press her, she revived to the knowledge of what remained to her. ""You are very kind not to reproach me,"" she said: ""I weep, and a bitter pang of intolerable sorrow tears my heart."
Perdita looked at him like one amazed; her expressive countenance shone for a moment with tenderness; to see him only was happiness.
"""But when I saw you become the object of another's love; when I imagined that you might be loved otherwise than as a sacred type and image of loveliness and excellence; or that you might love another with a more ardent affection than that which you bore to me, then the fiend awoke within me; I dismissed your lover; and from that moment I have known no peace."

This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.

He was detained three days longer and then he hastened to her.
"And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?"

Yet how could I find this?
She alone knew the weight which Raymond attached to his success.

"Thus full of contradictions, unbending yet haughty, gentle yet fierce, tender and again neglectful, he by some strange art found easy entrance to the admiration and affection of women; now caressing and now tyrannizing over them according to his mood, but in every change a despot."
"Her eyes could not be deeper than they were in childhood, nor her countenance more expressive; but the expression was changed and improved; intelligence sat on her brow; when she smiled her face was embellished by the softest sensibility, and her low, modulated voice seemed tuned by love."

"Never did any woman appear so entirely made of mind, as the Countess of Windsor."
Idris had shared Perdita's ill opinion of the Greek; but Raymond's account softened and interested her.
Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
"But these are precious moments; devil as I am become, yet that is my Mathilda before me whom I love as one was never before loved: and she knows it now; she listens to these words which I thought, fool as I was, would blast her to death."
"Yet, when she stood in unassuming simplicity before us, playing with our children, or with girlish assiduity performing little kind offices for Idris, one wondered in what fair lineament of her pure loveliness, in what soft tone of her thrilling voice, so much of heroism, sagacity and active goodness resided."
"HALF England was desolate, when October came, and the equinoctial winds swept over the earth, chilling the ardours of the unhealthy season."
"The death of many of our inmates had weaned us from the fond idea, that Windsor Castle was a spot sacred from the plague; but our lease of life was renewed for some months, and even Idris lifted her head, as a lily after a storm, when a last sunbeam tinges its silver cup."

"She loved him as a kind elder brother; a relation to guide, protect, and instruct her, without the too frequent tyranny of parental authority."
"Yes it was despair I felt; for the first time that phantom seized me; the first and only time for it has never since left me After the first moments of speechless agony I felt her fangs on my heart: I tore my hair; I raved aloud; at one moment in pity for his sufferings I would have clasped my father in my arms; and then starting back with horror I spurned him with my foot; I felt as if stung by a serpent, as if scourged by a whip of scorpions which drove me Ah Whither Whither?"
At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.
"The country afforded no such mass of horrors; solitary wretches died in the open fields; and I have found a survivor in a vacant village, contending at once with famine and disease; but the assembly of pestilence, the banqueting hall of death, was spread only in London."

"At the end of a month he suddenly quitted his house and, unatteneded sic by any servant, departed from that part of the country without by word or writing informing any one of his intentions."
During my wanderings I never slept without first calling down gentle dreams on your head.
We sat like one family round my hearth.
"Such were we upon earth, wondering aghast at the effects of pestilence."
"The blue and troubled sea sped past the vessel, and was spread shoreless around: the sky was covered by a rack, which in its swift motion shewed how speedily she was borne away."

Perdita's mind was not softened by this account.
"He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes."
About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.
"All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears."
"Close to the spot on which we stood, was a solitary rock, high and conical, which, divided on every side from the mountain, seemed a nature hewn pyramid; with little labour this block was reduced to a perfect shape; the narrow cell was scooped out beneath in which Raymond was placed, and a short inscription, carved in the living stone, recorded the name of its tenant, the cause and aera of his death."
The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
"I entered its gloomy walls in a fit of triumphant extasy: ""He feels me now,"" I cried, ""and shall, again and again"" I passed but one day in confinement; in the evening I was liberated, as I was told, by the order of the Earl himself."
"Yet a whole life of falsehood was otherwise my portion: and when remorse at being the contriver of any cheat made me shrink from my design I was irresistably led back and confirmed in it by the visit of some aunt or cousin, who would tell me that death was the end of all men."
"No office, no devotion, no watching was irksome to her, as it regarded him."

"Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold."
"The unexampled loveliness of the flower clad earth the genial sunshine and grateful shade the melody of the birds the majesty of the woods the splendour of the marble ruins the clear effulgence of the stars by night the combination of all that was exciting and voluptuous in this transcending land, by inspiring a quicker spirit of life and an added sensitiveness to every articulation of her frame, only gave edge to the poignancy of her grief."
"This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity."
"Ah If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy."""
"I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing."
"Again in vengeance of his wrath he falls On their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls; Arrests their navies on the ocean's plain, And whelms their strength with mountains of the main."
"Adrian it is true had already gone to seek the fugitive, imagining that her tameless anxiety had led her to the purlieus of the House, and that some sinister event detained her."

"Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you."
The district which contained them appeared the abode of every kindly spirit.
"Heavy falls of snow gave an arctic appearance to the scenery; the roofs of the houses peeped from the white mass; the lowly cot and stately mansion, alike deserted, were blocked up, their thresholds uncleared; the windows were broken by the hail, while the prevalence of a north east wind rendered out door exertions extremely painful."
Do not turn from me; I do not ask you to reveal it: I only entreat you to listen to me and to become familiar with the voice of consolation and kindness.
"Adrian's countenance flitted across, tainted by death Idris, with eyes languidly closed and livid lips, was about to slide into the wide grave."
I I alone was the cause of his defeat and justly did I pay the fearful penalty.
"I gasped for breath ""I will not detail to you,"" continued Raymond, ""the melancholy particulars."
"I forgot the distance between us: ""I will go with thee, Raymond"" I cried; but, my eye removed from the glass, I could scarce discern the pigmy forms of the crowd, which about a mile from me surrounded the gate; the form of Raymond was lost."
I am not yet fallen so low; my honour is not yet so tarnished.

The merriment of the hour was an unholy mockery of the sorrows of man.
"If, on the contrary, they are proof against expostulation, this very steadiness is an omen of success; and it becomes the duty of those who love them, to assist in smoothing the obstructions in their path."

"Still Perdita would expect him; he wrote a few incoherent words on a scrap of paper, testifying that he was well, and bade the woman of the house take it to the palace, and deliver it into the hands of the wife of the Lord Protector."
"I wept for a long time untill I saw him about to revive, when horror and misery again recurred, and the tide of my sensations rolled back to their former channel: with a terror I could not restrain I sprung up and fled, with winged speed, along the paths of the wood and across the fields untill nearly dead I reached our house and just ordering the servants to seek my father at the spot I indicated, I shut myself up in my own room."
Organs of articulate sound did not proclaim the union of our hearts; for untoward circumstance allowed no opportunity for the expression that hovered on our lips.
I had several times seen him ride across the heath and felt angry that my solitude should be disturbed.
Woodville was free from all these evils; and if slight examples did come across him he did not notice them but passed on in his course as an angel with winged feet might glide along the earth unimpeded by all those little obstacles over which we of earthly origin stumble.
"When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay."

"The change of scene operated to a great degree as I expected; after a year's absence, Perdita returned in gentler and more docile mood to Windsor."

Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?
"Yet when I effected my purpose, all I could discern within the precincts of the massive walls was a city of fire: the open way through which Raymond had ridden was enveloped in smoke and flame."

"I had wandered towards Bracknel, far to the west of Windsor."
"He said this in his most gay, yet benevolent manner, and smiled, not disdainfully, but in playful mockery of himself."
"He had introduced himself to Adrian, by a request he made to observe some planetary motions from his glass."
I had visited it frequently during my boyhood.
"Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments."
"There was so much intelligence combined with innocence, sensibility with forbearance, and seriousness with perfect good humour, a beauty so transcendant, united to such endearing simplicity, that she hung like a pearl in the shrine of our possessions, a treasure of wonder and excellence."
"England, late birth place of excellence and school of the wise, thy children are gone, thy glory faded Thou, England, wert the triumph of man Small favour was shewn thee by thy Creator, thou Isle of the North; a ragged canvas naturally, painted by man with alien colours; but the hues he gave are faded, never more to be renewed."
"One only return did he owe me, even fidelity."
Still his mother did not despair.
This was not universal.
"The spirit of superstition had birth, from the wreck of our hopes, and antics wild and dangerous were played on the great theatre, while the remaining particle of futurity dwindled into a point in the eyes of the prognosticators."
"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer."
"In our happiest days, Perdita had adorned her cottage with every aid art might bring, to that which nature had selected to favour."
"""Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica she looked so frank hearted and happy."
"We still had some attendants spared by disease, and warmly attached to us."
I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man.
"The forest glades, the ferny dells, and lawny uplands, the cultivated and cheerful country spread around the silver pathway of ancient Thames, all earth, air, and wave, took up one choral voice, inspired by memory, instinct with plaintive regret."
"But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend."
"But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result."
The moon I gazed with a kind of wonder.
"On the th of December of that year, my companion and I crossed the Bay, to visit the antiquities which are scattered on the shores of Baiae."
"The natural clinging of the human mind to life and joy was in its full energy in her young heart; she gave herself impetuously up to the enchantment: they were married; and in their radiant features I saw incarnate, for the last time, the spirit of love, of rapturous sympathy, which once had been the life of the world."
"Evadne was two years older than Adrian; and who, at eighteen, ever loved one so much their junior?"
"Poor girl She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity."
"They went to the river to break the ice, and draw water: they assembled on foraging expeditions, or axe in hand felled the trees for fuel."
"All I can say is, that it is so."
"Among a race of independent, and generous, and well educated men, in a country where the imagination is empress of men's minds, there needs be no fear that we should want a perpetual succession of the high born and lordly."
I renounced it to gain no matter what for that also I have lost.
The words of his letter by which he had dissuaded me from this step were those that determined me.
"""William is dead that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay Victor, he is murdered ""I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction."
"The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys."
"""We cannot hope to live so long in our names as some have done in their persons; one face of Janus holds no proportion to the other."""
Were not the mightiest men of the olden times kings?
"Perhaps there was besides a lurking dislike to bind herself in the face of the world to one whom she did not love not love, at least, with that passionate enthusiasm which her heart told her she might one day feel towards another."
"Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon."
"I smiled incredulously, and replied: ""I am of Ryland's way of thinking, and will, if you please, repeat all his arguments; we shall see how far you will be induced by them, to change the royal for the patriotic style."""
"Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror."
"I saw him too; he was free last night"" ""I do not know what you mean,"" replied my brother, in accents of wonder, ""but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery."
"Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult."
"I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me."
"One thing you must promise, not to speak to any one but your uncle, of the conversation you have just overheard."
"He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts."
"I administered the fitting remedies, and left my sweet niece to watch beside him, and bring me notice of any change she should observe."
"If she were to continue inflexible in the line of conduct she now pursued, they must part."
"How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood."
For my hope who shall see it?
There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies.
I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.
"She encouraged his craving for knowledge and his impetuous courage; she even tolerated his tameless love of freedom, under the hope that this would, as is too often the case, lead to a passion for command."
"At first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to such of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts on our fellow creatures."
"Meanwhile her active fancy wove a thousand combinations; she dreamt ""of moving accidents by flood and field"" she lost herself delightedly in these self created wanderings, and returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life."
"Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, ""You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?"
"He sent even to Italy and Greece for drawings; but, as the design was to be characterized by originality as well as by perfect beauty, his endeavours were for a time without avail."
"Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?"
"The air resounded with their shouts; their picturesque costume, and the gay colours of which it was composed, flaunted in the sunshine; their eager gestures and rapid utterance accorded with their wild appearance."
At this period the name and exploits of one of my countrymen filled the world with admiration.
"Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly."
"There was so much of truth and nature in his resentment, that her doubts were dispelled."
"Alas He is cold, he cannot answer me."""
"What can I say? if you refuse to aid me, I am lost indeed"" She cast up her eyes, while wonder held her auditors mute; then, as if carried away by her feelings, she cried ""My brother beloved, ill fated Adrian how speak of your misfortunes?"
"However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night."
"It seems as if the giant waves of ocean, and vast arms of the sea, were about to wrench the deep rooted island from its centre; and cast it, a ruin and a wreck, upon the fields of the Atlantic."
"The disposition of Idris was peculiarly frank, soft, and affectionate."
I remained for several years their only child.
"After the lapse of more than a year, Adrian returned from Greece."
"Thus perhaps as the sensation of immediate suffering wore off, I became more human."
"It was a curious fact, that at this period, when by the marriage of Perdita I was allied to one of the richest individuals in England, and was bound by the most intimate friendship to its chiefest noble, I experienced the greatest excess of poverty that I had ever known."
"He was all gaiety; scraps of songs fell from his lips; every thought of his mind every object about us, gleamed under the sunshine of his mirth."
"The body of the man who had landed, had been buried deep in the sands; and none could tell more, than that the vessel was American built, and that several months before the Fortunatas had sailed from Philadelphia, of which no tidings were afterwards received."
"Each long hour was counted, and ""He suffers"" was the burthen of all her thoughts."
"I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet."
"My father was one of those men on whom nature had bestowed to prodigality the envied gifts of wit and imagination, and then left his bark of life to be impelled by these winds, without adding reason as the rudder, or judgment as the pilot for the voyage."
"Not so with us, the remnant."
"""Justine Moritz Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?"
"Many of our visitors left us: those whose homes were far in the south, fled delightedly from our northern winter, and sought their native land, secure of plenty even after their fearful visitation."
The last words of Evadne were the seal upon the warrant of my death.
Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.
"Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter."
"In a moment however she revived, and, with energy, almost with violence, entreated me to saddle horses, to take her away, away to London to her brother at least to save her."
"The wind, favourable to him, blew so strongly in shore, that we were unable, as we had at first intended, to meet him on his watery road."
"The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness."
The pain inflicted by this disappointment was tormenting and keen.
"""You are in the wrong,"" replied the fiend; ""and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you."
"""She was"", he said, ""the brightest vision that ever came upon the earth: there was somthing in her frank countenance, in her voice, and in every motion of her graceful form that overpowered me, as if it were a celestial creature that deigned to mingle with me in intercourse more sweet than man had ever before enjoyed."
"I afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder."
"Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret."
My aunt was only relieved of her anxiety concerning his fate by a letter from him dated Hamburgh.
"Oh, this was a delicious life quite void of guile I with my dove's look and fox's heart: for indeed I felt only the degradation of falsehood, and not any sacred sentiment of conscious innocence that might redeem it."
"It was part of the Ex Queen's plan, to surround her son with princely magnificence."
"""My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."""
"For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her."
"With the declining heat of a September night, a whirlwind of storm, thunder, and hail, rattled round the house, and with ghastly harmony sung the dirge of her family."
"He heartily despised himself, he was angry with Perdita, and the idea of Evadne was attended by all that was hideous and cruel."
"I looked back to my restless desires and painful struggles with my fellow beings as to a troubled dream, and felt myself as much changed as if I had transmigrated into another form, whose fresh sensorium and mechanism of nerves had altered the reflection of the apparent universe in the mirror of mind."
"Take me mould me to your will, possess my heart and soul to all eternity."
"She neglected even her child; shutting her heart against all tenderness, she grew reserved towards me, her first and fast friend."
"For a moment I could yield to the creative power of the imagination, and for a moment was soothed by the sublime fictions it presented to me."
"I would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely defended my dear ones against sorrow and pain; and if I were vanquished at last, it should not be ingloriously."
"Her intrigues with Russia for the furtherance of her object, excited the jealousy of the Porte, and the animosity of the Greek government."
"It was madness I believe, but I so worked myself up to this idea that I could think of nothing else."
"Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature."
"The air is empoisoned, and each human being inhales death, even while in youth and health, their hopes are in the flower."
"Wretched devil You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed."""
She was for a while the sole object of his reveries; and Perdita became aware that his thoughts and time were bestowed on a subject unparticipated by her.
The physical state of man would soon not yield to the beatitude of angels; disease was to be banished; labour lightened of its heaviest burden.
My own heart was racked by regrets and remorse.
"A short conversation passed between us, but the next day he again stopped at my cottage and by degrees an intimacy grew between us."
"""Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions."
"For the first time in my life I envied the sleep of the dead, and thought with pleasure of one's bed under the sod, where grief and fear have no power."
I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
"So that when we make our hearts a lair for that gently seeming beast, its companion enters with it, and pitilessly lays waste what might have been an home and a shelter."""
Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses.
This idea was torture to him.
"If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends."""
"Our numbers were to move forward in separate parties, and to go by different routes, all to unite at last at Paris."
"Raymond, the deliverer of Greece, the graceful soldier, who bore in his mien a tinge of all that, peculiar to her native clime, Evadne cherished as most dear Raymond was loved by Evadne."
And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.
"If my last combat is now about to be fought, and I am to be worsted so let it be"" ""But come, Ryland, recollect yourself Men have hitherto thought you magnanimous and wise, will you cast aside these titles?"
I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
"They shall go down together to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust Yes my hope was corruption and dust and all to which death brings us."
Thou and nature are still true to me.
At length the rooms began to thin.
"At length we arrived at a large, desert, dark cavern, which the Lazzeroni assured us was the Sibyl's Cave."
"Readiness of talent, a capacity of entering into, and leading the dispositions of men; earnest desire of distinction were the awakeners and nurses of his ambition."
"Expectation, and hopes, and affection were all too much for me."
"With such schooling did my poor Idris try to hush thronging fears, and in some measure succeeded."
I do not address them to you alone because it will give me pleasure to dwell upon our friendship in a way that would be needless if you alone read what I shall write.
"Live stock diminished sensibly in the country, from the effects of the great demand in the market."
At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
"The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise."
"How in poor assemblage of words convey the halo of glory that surrounded her, the thousand graces that waited unwearied on her."
"You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes."
"She started wildly from her couch, and flew to the cabin window."
"I believe it was that coming out with a determination not to be repulsed I went right forward to my object without well weighing his replies: I was led by passion and drew him with frantic heedlessness into the abyss that he so fearfully avoided I replied to his terrific words: ""You fill me with affright it is true, dearest father, but you only confirm my resolution to put an end to this state of doubt."
"I grew impatient, I wept; sic and wrung my hands but still I could not discover my path."
"She had read no novels and associated only with her younger sisters, what could she know of the difference between love and friendship?"
"There is no fruition in their vacant kindness, and sharp rocks lurk beneath the smiling ripples of these shallow waters."
"He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet."
"We were about to return homewards, when a voice, a human voice, strange now to hear, attracted our attention."
"A few men came to aid him; their numbers increased; under their united blows the obstacle was vanquished, gate, portcullis, and fence were demolished; and the wide sun lit way, leading to the heart of the city, now lay open before them."
"As the rules of order and pressure of laws were lost, some began with hesitation and wonder to transgress the accustomed uses of society."
"We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it."
My dream recurred to my thoughts; I was not usually superstitious but in wretchedness every one is so.
"The aspect of the country had so far changed, that it had been impossible to enter on the task of sowing seed, and other autumnal labours."
"Then came the tale of hair breadth escapes, combats with dogs, ambush and flight, as gipsey like we encompassed our pot."
"I cannot live the object of suspicion you cannot believe me let us part"" ""Exactly so,"" cried Perdita, ""I knew that it would come to this Are we not already parted?"
"He wished to repay the kindness of the Athenians, to keep alive the splendid associations connected with his name, and to eradicate from Europe a power which, while every other nation advanced in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique barbarism."
You may see him his hair stuck with wild flowers his eyes full of untraceable meaning his voice broken his person wasted to a shadow.
"During the first months of his Protectorate, Raymond and she had been inseparable; each project was discussed with her, each plan approved by her."
He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.
"""Come,"" said Raymond, ""I yielded to you yesterday, now comply with my request take the pencil."""
Her guardian was not displeased with their mutual affection: the merit of Woodville was too eminent to admit of cavil on account of his inferior wealth; but the dying will of her father did not allow her to marry before she was of age and her fortune depended upon her obeying this injunction.
The very danger drew them closer.
"The myrtle bushes, the thyme, the little cyclamen, which peep from the fissures of the rock, all the produce of the place, bear affinity to him; the light that invests the hills participates in his essence, and sky and mountains, sea and valley, are imbued by the presence of his spirit."
"""She most of all,"" said Ernest, ""requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched."
"He was not at the palace; and, though the attendants did not know whither he had gone, they did not expect him till late at night."
"Ever after this, I thought, I would live in the most dreary seclusion."
"Besides, is it not a shame, that the genius of Adrian should fade from the earth like a flower in an untrod mountain path, fruitless?"
"""I do know you better,"" I replied ""than to think that you would be happy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be an inducement, since the time is probably arrived when you can put your theories into practice, and you may bring about such reformation and change, as will conduce to that perfect system of government which you delight to portray."""
"I will live and die here ""Go you to England, Lionel; return to sweet Idris and dearest Adrian; return, and let my orphan girl be as a child of your own in your house."
"When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before."
"Many saw, seated above his vice regal throne, a supreme Providence, who directed his shafts, and guided his progress, and they bowed their heads in resignation, or at least in obedience."
"My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement."
The appearance of the plain was changed during this short interval; the encampment was broken up; the relics of the disbanded army met in small companies here and there; each face was clouded; every gesture spoke astonishment and dismay.
"Here I hold communion only with the has been, and to come."
"Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?"
"He spoke with a broken voice, then bowed his head, and, hiding his face in his hands, wept."
"He recognised the hand writing of Evadne, and the colour mounted in his cheeks."
"I was already well acquainted with what I may term the panorama of nature, the change of seasons, and the various appearances of heaven and earth."
"How ill you are What is the cause of all this?"" ""Do not ask me,"" cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; ""HE can tell."
"But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart."
"Alas I am a most unhappy creature"" I was breathless with emotion, and I paused fixing my earnest eyes on my father, after I had dashed away the intrusive tears that dimmed them."
She was lovely; her manners were frank and simple; her deep blue eyes swam in a lustre which could only be given by sensibility joined to wisdom.
"She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer."
"In the mean time, while I thus pampered myself with rich mental repasts, a peasant would have disdained my scanty fare, which I sometimes robbed from the squirrels of the forest."
"We visited the north of England, my native Ulswater, and lingered in scenes dear from a thousand associations."
"It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous."
"""You have learnt a pretty lesson, Perdita,"" said I, ""and repeat it so literally, that you forget the while the proofs we have of the Earl's virtues; his generosity to us is manifest in our plenty, his bravery in the protection he affords us, his affability in the notice he takes of us."
I slept too undisturbed by dreams; and awoke refreshed to again enjoy my tranquil freedom.
"M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman."
By day and night these thoughts pursued me.
"I dared hardly consider you as my daughter; your beauty, artlessness and untaught wisdom seemed to belong to a higher order of beings; your voice breathed forth only words of love: if there was aught of earthly in you it was only what you derived from the beauty of the world; you seemed to have gained a grace from the mountain breezes the waterfalls and the lake; and this was all of earthly except your affections that you had; there was no dross, no bad feeling in the composition."
"I felt as the sailor, who from the topmast first discovered the shore of America; and like him I hastened to tell my companions of my discoveries in unknown regions."
"Raymond felt no relief, received no pleasure from any show of heaven or earth."
"This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, ""You are all mistaken; I know the murderer."
"She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman."
"Be you witnesses,"" and he took the star, insignia of office, from his breast, and threw it on the table."
"Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes."
"I left her, and soon heard that she slept soundly under the influence of the opiate I had administered."
"For my own part, since Adrian had first withdrawn me from my selvatic wilderness to his own paradise of order and beauty, I had been wedded to literature."
"At the same time that he taught me by their means to subdue my own reckless and uncultured spirit, he opened to my view the living page of his own heart, and gave me to feel and understand its wondrous character."
"I was led to London, and had to endure for some weeks cold looks, cold words and colder consolations: but I escaped; they tried to bind me with fetters that they thought silken, yet which weighed on me like iron, although I broke them more easily than a girth formed of a single straw and fled to freedom."
"I wandered on, and the coming darkness made every trace indistinct by which I might be guided."
The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.
This account may be taken as a sample of my intercourse with Lord Raymond.
"He dismissed his servants there, only telling them that he had a sudden call of business and that they were to obey me as their mistress untill his return."
"My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness."
"And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?"
"The appetite for admiration and small capacity for self controul which I inherited from my father, nursed by adversity, made me daring and reckless."
"The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion."
"""They shout,"" I said, ""because they will soon return to England."" ""Do you, then, really return?"" ""Alas Yes; I cannot withstand their demands."
"He would rather have died such a death, which will be recorded in history to endless time, than have lived to old age unknown, unhonoured."
There is my hope and my expectation; your's are in this world; may they be fulfilled.
"Shame shame if the first magistrate of England be foremost to renounce his duties."""
This was all accomplished even as I wished.
"Among his other advantages, Lord Raymond was supremely handsome; every one admired him; of women he was the idol."
The meal was quickly dispatched.
"I began to study more; to sympathize more in the thoughts of others as expressed in books; to read history, and to lose my individuallity among the crowd that had existed before me."
"Methought I had been invited to Timon's last feast; I came with keen appetite, the covers were removed, the hot water sent up its unsatisfying steams, while I fled before the anger of the host, who assumed the form of Raymond; while to my diseased fancy, the vessels hurled by him after me, were surcharged with fetid vapour, and my friend's shape, altered by a thousand distortions, expanded into a gigantic phantom, bearing on its brow the sign of pestilence."
"From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.' ""'May I know the names and residence of those friends?' ""I paused."
"In Greece I had learnt to love him; his very waywardness, and self abandonment to the impulses of superstition, attached me to him doubly; it might be weakness, but it was the antipodes of all that was grovelling and selfish."
"O blessed sleep Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture."
"Immediately before me was the Top Kapou, the gate near which Mahomet had made the breach by which he entered the city."
We had remained five months in London three of joy and two of sorrow.
She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.
"This may seem madness to you, yet you also have pride and resolution; do not then wonder that my pride is tameless, my resolution unalterable."""
"This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess."
"The very heart and soul of Raymond and Perdita had mingled, even as two mountain brooks that join in their descent, and murmuring and sparkling flow over shining pebbles, beside starry flowers; but let one desert its primal course, or be dammed up by choaking obstruction, and the other shrinks in its altered banks."
"Each day, before dawn, we left our night's encampment, and watched the shadows as they retreated from hill and valley, and the golden splendour of the sun's approach."

"As I waited there in expectation of that moment, I thought how, of the lovely flowers that grew there, I would wind myself a chaplet and crown myself for joy: I would sing sul margine d'un rio, my father's favourite song, and that my voice gliding through the windless air would announce to him in whatever bower he sat expecting the moment of our union, that his daughter was come."

Great God would it one day be thus?
"There is something fearful in one who can thus conquer the animal part of our nature, if the victory be not the effect of consummate virtue; nor was it without a mixture of this feeling, that I beheld the figure of the Countess awake when others slept, fasting when I, abstemious naturally, and rendered so by the fever that preyed on me, was forced to recruit myself with food."
"Hours passed, while in this scene of ruin I sought for Raymond."
"Perdita presented her to Raymond; her first words were: ""Beloved, embrace our child"" ""Come hither, sweet one,"" said her father, ""do you not know me?"" she knew his voice, and cast herself in his arms with half bashful but uncontrollable emotion."

"And morning and evening my tearful eyes raised to heaven, my hands clasped tight in the energy of prayer, I have repeated with the poet Before I see another day Oh, let this body die away Let me not be reproached then with inutility; I believed that by suicide I should violate a divine law of nature, and I thought that I sufficiently fulfilled my part in submitting to the hard task of enduring the crawling hours minutes in bearing the load of time that weighed miserably upon me and that in abstaining from what I in my calm moments considered a crime, I deserved the reward of virtue."

Discipline was lost; the army disbanded itself.
"As we talked thus, I perceived that we were not going the ordinary road to Windsor, but through Englefield Green, towards Bishopgate Heath."
"To you alone do I dare speak; I have heard you commended by impartial spectators; you are my brother's friends, therefore you must be mine."
"As a last effort, my sister mustered her strength, her firmness; she stepped from one boat to the other, and then with a shriek she sprang towards Raymond, knelt at his side, and glueing her lips to the hand she seized, her face shrouded by her long hair, gave herself up to tears."
"I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held."

"I was awake, and during the long hours of dead night, my busy thoughts worked in my brain, like ten thousand mill wheels, rapid, acute, untameable."
"All of soul inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought."
"Adrian and Idris saw this; they attributed it to my long watching and anxiety; they urged me to rest, and take care of myself, while I most truly assured them, that my best medicine was their good wishes; those, and the assured convalescence of my friend, now daily more apparent."

"""No, no,"" he said, ""do not deceive yourself, me you cannot."
He beholds in me one whom he has injured even unto death; and I derive no hope from his kindness; no change can possibly be brought about even by his best intentions.

"I could only do this on foot, as the mass of ruin was impracticable for a horse."
"The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness."
CHAPTER II I now come to my own story.
"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history."
"Farewell, Raymond; be happy in having chosen the better part in life."
War was at last tacitly acknowledged between us.
Already she fears for us.
"But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route."
"""Ah, Raymond, were we not happy?"
"We quitted London on the th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest."
"When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix."
"""I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring."
But for one thing he would have been completely triumphant.
"It was found, that, though at first the stop put to all circulation of property, had reduced those before supported by the factitious wants of society to sudden and hideous poverty, yet when the boundaries of private possession were thrown down, the products of human labour at present existing were more, far more, than the thinned generation could possibly consume."
"I do not know that any will peruse these pages except you, my friend, who will receive them at my death."
"""Mad and foolish boy"" exclaimed the angry lady, ""you have chosen with dreams and theories to overthrow my schemes for your own aggrandizement; but you shall not do the same by those I have formed for your sister."
"I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul."
"Can my soul, inextricably linked to this perishable frame, become lethargic and cold, even as this sensitive mechanism shall lose its youthful elasticity?"
"Chapter I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it."
"I told him of the business of the evening, and a smile relaxed the contracted muscles."
"The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey."
"I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows."
"Alas for these latter days The world had grown old, and all its inmates partook of the decrepitude."
"Above all, the anxious mother, my own beloved and drooping Idris, claimed my earnest care; I could not reproach the anxiety that never for a moment slept in her heart, but I exerted myself to distract her attention from too keen an observation of the truth of things, of the near and nearer approaches of disease, misery, and death, of the wild look of our attendants as intelligence of another and yet another death reached us; for to the last something new occurred that seemed to transcend in horror all that had gone before."
"I related my adventures of the night, my endeavours to find our lost one, and my disappointment."
Her whole appearance awakened his deepest interest.
"When Idris entered, so far had Raymond forgotten himself, that he asked for my sister; one word, which told of her mysterious disappearance, recalled him."
"You, who fancy that you can read the human soul, as your native lake reads each crevice and folding of its surrounding hills say what you think of me; king expectant, angel or devil, which?"""
"One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty."
"Alas I could never have believed that it was indeed Elinor that died if once when I spoke she had not lifted her almost benighted eyes, and for one moment like nought beside on earth, more lovely than a sunbeam, slighter, quicker than the waving plumage of a bird, dazzling as lightning and like it giving day to night, yet mild and faint, that smile came; it went, and then there was an end of all joy to me."""
"It was through her beloved lessons that he cast off his old pursuits and gradually formed himself to become one among his fellow men; a distinguished member of society, a Patriot; and an enlightened lover of truth and virtue."
"""For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever."
"I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles."
"To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?"
"Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer."
"Fear has been said to be the parent of religion: even of that religion is it the generator, which leads its votaries to sacrifice human victims at its altars; but the religion which springs from happiness is a lovelier growth; the religion which makes the heart breathe forth fervent thanksgiving, and causes us to pour out the overflowings of the soul before the author of our being; that which is the parent of the imagination and the nurse of poetry; that which bestows benevolent intelligence on the visible mechanism of the world, and makes earth a temple with heaven for its cope."
"Still I would not hurry on; I would pause for ever on the recollections of these happy weeks; I would repeat every word, and how many do I remember, record every enchantment of the faery habitation."
"This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin."

"She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known."
"She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness."
"If his heart had slept but a few years longer, he might have been saved; but it awoke in its infancy; it had power, but no knowledge; and it was ruined, even as a too early blowing bud is nipt by the killing frost."
"But he was impatient of the years that must intervene, he was frank of heart and fearless."
"How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin."""
"She listened to me as she had done to the narration of my adventures, and sometimes took an interest in this species of information; but she did not, as I did, look on it as an integral part of her being, which having obtained, I could no more put off than the universal sense of touch."
"Can the ship wrecked mariner, who spent with swimming, hears close behind the splashing waters divided by a shark which pursues him through the Atlantic, hope?"
"The glory of life was gone for her; the roseate halo of love, which had imbued every object with its own colour, faded; she was content to take life as it was, and to make the best of leaden coloured reality."
"My alliance with him was the pledge of my sincerity, my union with his sister, my children, his presumptive heirs, were the hostages of my truth."
"I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about."
"It was more common, for all who possessed landed property to secede to their estates, attended by whole troops of the indigent, to cut down their woods to erect temporary dwellings, and to portion out their parks, parterres and flower gardens, to necessitous families."
"Order, comfort, and even health, rose under his influence, as from the touch of a magician's wand."
Adrian was now fifteen years of age.
My father felt this kindness; for a moment ambitious dreams floated before him; and he thought that it would be well to exchange his present pursuits for nobler duties.
"The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse."
"Come with me to my room; we will remain there till the hour agreed upon."""
"She refused with a smile, reminding him that for the present his sister had promised to be patient."
"Soon, alas was one to conquer."
Their occasional deaths filled my infant heart with anguish.
"If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more."
"If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure."
Its presence gave me a hope that by its means I might find my home.
"New feelings had arisen within her, which she was unable to express in writing to one whom she had only known in childhood; but we saw each other again, and our intimacy was renewed as if nothing had intervened to check it."
"I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt."
"I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how."
"The nature of riches and influence forcibly confined the list of candidates to a few of the wealthiest; and it was much to be feared, that the ill humour and contention generated by this triennial struggle, would counterbalance its advantages in impartial eyes."
"high aspirations cause the flow of my blood; my eyes seem to penetrate the cloudy midnight of time, and to discern within the depths of its darkness, the fruition of all my soul desires."
My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.
"The mounting flames had curled round the building, as it fell, and was destroyed."
"Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where I had deposited the corpse."
"Now pause During my journey I might dream, and with buoyant wings reach the summit of life's high edifice."
"He,"" he continued, pointing to the corpse, ""he suffered not in the consummation of the deed."
"It was not so with me; and the question of rank and right dwindled to insignificance in my eyes, when I pictured the scene of suffering Athens."
"When their course is fulfilled, the dial begins to cast westward an uncertain shadow; the eye lids of day are opened, and birds and flowers, the startled vegetation, and fresh breeze awaken; the sun at length appears, and in majestic procession climbs the capitol of heaven."
"Nature, our mother, and our friend, had turned on us a brow of menace."
"Strange system riddle of the Sphynx, most awe striking that thus man remains, while we the individuals pass away."
"Plague might not revive with the summer; but if it did, it should find us prepared."
"""Do not think that I would intrude upon your confidence: I only ask your patience."
"Let him bare his arm and transfix me with lightning this is also one of his attributes"" and the old man laughed."
"They seldom addressed each other, shunning explanation, each fearing any communication the other might make."
"He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it."
"When the latter died this sister was taken by her maternal relations: they had seldom seen one another, and were quite unlike in disposition."
Chapter My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.
"He gave me an illustrious name and noble station; the world's respect reflected from his own glory: all this joined to his own undying love, inspired me with sensations towards him, akin to those with which we regard the Giver of life."
"He had sinned against his own honour, by affirming, swearing to, a direct falsehood; true this he had palmed on a woman, and it might therefore be deemed less base by others not by him; for whom had he deceived?"
"Sights of woe now became familiar to me, and were I to tell all of anguish and pain that I witnessed, of the despairing moans of age, and the more terrible smiles of infancy in the bosom of horror, my reader, his limbs quivering and his hair on end, would wonder how I did not, seized with sudden frenzy, dash myself from some precipice, and so close my eyes for ever on the sad end of the world."
"Methinks his spirit remains here as well as that dust, which, uncommunicable though it be, is more precious in its nothingness than aught else widowed earth clasps to her sorrowing bosom."
"Surely the glorious twins of Latona were not more welcome, when, in the infancy of the world, they were brought forth to beautify and enlighten this ""sterile promontory,"" than were this angelic pair to my lowly dwelling and grateful heart."
"Where could we turn, and not find a desolation pregnant with the dire lesson of example?"
"As the country people poured into London, the citizens fled southwards they climbed the higher edifices of the town, fancying that they could discern the smoke and flames the enemy spread around them."
Her internal pride and humility of manner were now more than ever at war.
"From my youth I have said, I will be virtuous; I will dedicate my life for the good of others; I will do my best to extirpate evil and if the spirit who protects ill should so influence circumstances that I should suffer through my endeavour, yet while there is hope and hope there ever must be, of success, cheerfully do I gird myself to my task."
"She endeavoured to read his thought, and then answered with dignity, ""As you please."
"A moment more and the old walls again met my sight, while over them hovered a murky cloud; fragments of buildings whirled above, half seen in smoke, while flames burst out beneath, and continued explosions filled the air with terrific thunders."
They spurn and hate me.
"Frankness and social feelings were the essence of Raymond's nature; without them his qualities became common place; without these to spread glory over his intercourse with Perdita, his vaunted exchange of a throne for her love, was as weak and empty as the rainbow hues which vanish when the sun is down."
"He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion."
In those days the rest of the world was nothing to me: all other men I never considered nor felt what they were; nor did I look on you as one of them.
"Perhaps a history such as mine had better die with me, but a feeling that I cannot define leads me on and I am too weak both in body and mind to resist the slightest impulse."
"Raymond could not resist these signs of distress: he felt perhaps somewhat ashamed of the part he acted of the injured man, he who was in truth the injurer."
"As for instance, a typhus fever has been brought by ships to one sea port town; yet the very people who brought it there, were incapable of communicating it in a town more fortunately situated."
"It was a melancholy pleasure to me to listen to his inspired words; to catch for a moment the light of his eyes; to feel a transient sympathy and then to awaken from the delusion, again to know that all this was nothing, a dream a shadow for that there was no reallity for me; my father had for ever deserted me, leaving me only memories which set an eternal barrier between me and my fellow creatures."
"She answered my reasonings more briefly, declaring with disdain, that the reason was hers; and, until I could persuade her that the past could be unacted, that maturity could go back to the cradle, and that all that was could become as though it had never been, it was useless to assure her that no real change had taken place in her fate."
"He was sent to Cumberland; but the plan of correspondence between the lovers, arranged by Evadne, was effectually hidden from her."
"Yet, as he had lived on for months nearly in the same state, he did not inspire us with any immediate fear; and, though he talked of death as an event most familiar to his thoughts, he did not cease to exert himself to render others happy, or to cultivate his own astonishing powers of mind."
"We met baggage waggons, and many females of high and low rank returning to Fairy or Kishan, there to wait the issue of the expected day."
The flames of the city bent beneath it; and the smoke and dust arising from the ruins was dissipated.
"Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime."
"But do you not see, that, under the idea of exalting me, he is chalking out a new path for himself; a path of action from which he has long wandered?"
"All slept all England slept; and from my window, commanding a wide prospect of the star illumined country, I saw the land stretched out in placid rest."
Shall I disturb this calm by mingling in the world?
"Shall the daughter of the noble, though prodigal Zaimi, appear a beggar before her compeers or inferiors superiors she had none."
"""Perdita,"" I had said, ""some day you will discover that you have done wrong in again casting Raymond on the thorns of life."
"Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva."
"I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion."
"This undercurrent of thought, often soothed me amidst distress, and even agony."
"The labour necessary to bring the lands to this sort of culture, employed and fed the offcasts of the diminished manufactories."
"He died embracing the sod, which was piled above his breast, when he was placed beside the beings whom he regretted with such wild despair."
"Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize."
"I sometimes expostulated with Perdita on the subject of her reserve; but she rejected my counsels, while her daughter's sensibility excited in her a tenderness still more passionate."
"It was my task each day to visit the various families assembled in our town, and when the weather permitted, I was glad to prolong my ride, and to muse in solitude over every changeful appearance of our destiny, endeavouring to gather lessons for the future from the experience of the past."
"Such was the depth of my emotion that I had no feeling of what caused my distress, my thoughts even wandered to many indifferent objects; but still neither moving limb or feature my tears fell untill, as if the fountains were exhausted, they gradually subsided, and I awoke to life as from a dream."
"O ye heart strings of mine, could ye be torn asunder, and my soul not spend itself in tears of blood for sorrow Idris, after the first shock, regained a portion of fortitude."
Little Clara accompanied us; the poor child did not well understand what was going forward.
"With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore."
"She went on, feeling that, if she had paused for a moment, the checked waters of misery would have deluged her soul, that her wrecked hopes would raise their wailing voices, and that those who now echoed her mirth, and provoked her repartees, would have shrunk in fear from her convulsive despair."
"He promised that he would come and see me again; and bade me take cheer, and to encourage what happy thoughts I could, untill time and fortitude should overcome my misery, and I could again mingle in society."
"Your heart I fear, replied Diotima, was broken by your sufferings but if you had struggled if when you found all hope of earthly happiness wither within you while desire of it scorched your soul if you had near you a friend to have raised you to the contemplation of beauty the search of knowledge you would have found perhaps not new hopes spring within you but a new life distinct from that of passion by which you had before existed relate to me what this misery was that thus engroses you tell me what were the vicissitudes of feeling that you endured on earth after death our actions worldly interest fade as nothing before us but the traces of our feelings exist the memories of those are what furnish us here with eternal subject of meditation."
"Some, in the true spirit of reckless enterprise, went on board a ship of an hundred and twenty guns; the vast hull drifted with the tide out of the bay, and after many hours its crew of landsmen contrived to spread a great part of her enormous canvass the wind took it, and while a thousand mistakes of the helmsman made her present her head now to one point, and now to another, the vast fields of canvass that formed her sails flapped with a sound like that of a huge cataract; or such as a sea like forest may give forth when buffeted by an equinoctial north wind."
But I wander from my relation let woe come at its appointed time; I may at this stage of my story still talk of happiness.
"I proposed the enterprize of poaching on his demesne to my few remaining comrades, who were the most determined and lawless of the crew; but they all shrunk from the peril; so I was left to achieve my revenge myself."
"Stopping short, I clasped my hands, and with the fervour of a new proselyte, cried, ""Doubt me not, Adrian, I also will become wise and good"" and then quite overcome, I wept aloud."
"The images of health and hope which I presented to her, made her with a smile consent."
"The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade."
"The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court."
So I was entirely thrown upon my own resourses.
"There is nothing more lovely, to which the heart more yearns than a free spirited boy, gentle, brave, and generous."
"As yet, thank God, I am equal to the government of the town; and I look only to the present."
"He died soon after, leaving two children, a son and a daughter."
"Could I be other than all ear, to one who seemed to govern the whole earth in his grasping imagination, and who only quailed when he attempted to rule himself."
Even Perdita will rejoice.
"She hung over the patient in agony, which was not mitigated when her thoughts wandered towards her babes, for whom she feared infection."
He spoke with pride; he felt injured.
"To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return."
"Then I would hasten to my desk, weave the new found web of mind in firm texture and brilliant colours, leaving the fashioning of the material to a calmer moment."
I owe you six years of unalloyed happiness.
"He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence."
"It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir."
Raymond started angrily when he saw me.
"On the twenty first of June, it was said that an hour before noon, a black sun arose: an orb, the size of that luminary, but dark, defined, whose beams were shadows, ascended from the west; in about an hour it had reached the meridian, and eclipsed the bright parent of day."
"The rage and yells of the wounded man, the howling execrations of his comrade, which I answered with equal bitterness and fury, echoed through the dell; morning broke more and more, ill accordant in its celestial beauty with our brute and noisy contest."
I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.
"The woods around afforded us shade, the river secured to us a constant supply of water; nay, detachments were employed in furnishing the army with ice, which had been laid up on Haemus, and Athos, and the mountains of Macedonia, while cooling fruits and wholesome food renovated the strength of the labourers, and made us bear with less impatience the weight of the unrefreshing air."
"""The day is ours,"" he cried, ""the Turks fly from the bayonet."""
There was but one good and one evil in the world life and death.
"I passed from the palace of Sweet Waters to the plain on which the encampment lay, and found its inhabitants in commotion."
This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.
"The plague I am told is in Constantinople, perhaps I have imbibed its effluvia perhaps disease is the real cause of my prognostications."
The nobles did not hesitate to express their fear; the other party endeavoured to treat the matter lightly.
"I LIVED far from the busy haunts of men, and the rumour of wars or political changes came worn to a mere sound, to our mountain abodes."
"""The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest."""
It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.
"""As to the likelihood of escaping,"" said Adrian, ""ten years hence the cold stars may shine on the graves of all of us; but as to my peculiar liability to infection, I could easily prove, both logically and physically, that in the midst of contagion I have a better chance of life than you."
No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.
"First he was to visit Evadne, and then to hasten to the palace of the Protectorate."
"""Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions."
"But they were awed as I had been, at the change of his appearance."

"Unfeeling, heartless creator You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind."

"""Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection."
Such was his choice: he expected to die.
I had one female servant who spent the greater part of the day at a village two miles off.
But to convince you that selfish feeling does not entirely engross me I shall remain in this town untill you have made by letter every arrangement that you judge necessary.
"He might dissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him."
I was in the wrong to commence a system of concealment; but I did it for the sake of sparing you pain; and each day has rendered it more difficult for me to alter my plan.
As he walked among other men he seemed encompassed with a heavenly halo that divided him from and lifted him above them.
"My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended."
"There were many dear friends whom we must not leave behind, humble though they were."
Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.
"She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half suppressed emotion, ""Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer Live, and be happy, and make others so."""
"You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly."
"I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it."
"""This wound will probably shorten my life, having shattered a frame, weak of itself."
"Such was the power of man over the elements; a power long sought, and lately won; yet foretold in by gone time by the prince of poets, whose verses I quoted much to the astonishment of my pilot, when I told him how many hundred years ago they had been written: Oh human wit, thou can'st invent much ill, Thou searchest strange arts: who would think by skill, An heavy man like a light bird should stray, And through the empty heavens find a way?"
My first real knowledge of myself was as an unprotected orphan among the valleys and fells of Cumberland.
"I had been excited to the utmost by the proceedings of the day, and now more than ever by the passionate language of Raymond."
Raymond began the conversation somewhat abruptly.
In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.
"""You are sorrowful, my love."
The first secret that had existed between them was the visits of Raymond to Evadne.
"We got into his carriage, and proceeded towards Windsor."
"Let me lay my head near your heart; let me die in your arms"" He sunk to the earth fainting, while I, nearly as lifeless, gazed on him in despair."
"I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me."
"But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before."
"""I loved you I love you neither anger nor pride dictates these lines; but a feeling beyond, deeper, and more unalterable than either."
"Raymond was as usual courteous, though there was, on occasions, an unbidden haughtiness, or painful abruptness in his manners, which startled his gentle friend; his brow was not clouded but disdain sat on his lips, and his voice was harsh."
"At every inn where we changed horses we heard of him, and I was possessed by alternate hope and fear."
She dared not be present at the contest; yet she remained at home a prey to double solicitude.
Perdita looked up; she saw his angry glance; his hand was on the lock of the door.
He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.
"I have often wondered at the subject of her verses, and at the English dress of the Latin poet."
"But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge."""
"At the foot of this sublime chasm, a fertile laughing valley reached from sea to sea, and beyond was spread the blue Aegean, sprinkled with islands, the light waves glancing beneath the sun."
"Still Adrian was unable to guess the truth; he entreated them to visit us at Windsor, and they promised to come during the following month."
"""When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection."
"As we went he reminded me of what I was to say and do, yet, strange to say, I entered the chamber without having once reflected on my purpose."
"On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression."
Few people had discovered some cowardice and much infirmity of purpose under this imposing exterior.
"After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself."
"Evadne made it her earnest request that the tale of their loves should not be revealed to his mother; and after for a while contesting the point, he yielded it to her."
"The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips."
"She answered that I was right, and might do with her as I pleased."
"Ambition turned his thoughts from these designs ambition, which labouring through various lets and hindrances, had now led him to the summit of his hopes, in making him Lord Protector of England."
"Know yourself, Raymond, and your indignation will cease; your complacency return."
"Let fancy pourtray the joyous scene of the twentieth of June, such as even now my aching heart recalls it."
"I was an outcast and a vagabond, when Adrian gently threw over me the silver net of love and civilization, and linked me inextricably to human charities and human excellence."
"There was somthing in those dark deep orbs so liquid, and intense that even in happiness I could never meet their full gaze that mine did not overflow."
"I was always conscious of my state when my wild thoughts seemed to drive me to insanity, and never betrayed them to aught but silence and solitude."
"Still he had many friends, admirers of his transcendent talents; his presence in the house, his eloquence, address and imposing beauty, were calculated to produce an electric effect."
"""Do not catechise me, Lionel; I will do my duty by her, be assured."
"He heard of the passing events of the day; he knew that, if he returned, and resumed his place in society, the entrance was still open, and it required but the will, to surround himself at once with the associations and habits of boyhood."
"In spite of her coldness and long absence, he welcomed her with sensibility, displaying such affection as sought to heal the wounds of pride and sorrow, and was repulsed only by her total apparent want of sympathy."
"Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake."
"Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances."
"I am glad now to feel the current of thought flow through my mind, as the blood through the articulations of my frame; mere existence is pleasure; and I thank God that I live ""And all ye happy nurslings of mother earth, do ye not echo my words?"
I came in during the interval between the third and fourth act.
"As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this?"
"When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus."
"The neighbouring minister was engaged to give me lessons in reading, writing and french, but he was without family and his manners even to me were always perfectly characteristic of the profession in the exercise of whose functions he chiefly shone, that of a schoolmaster."
"With simplicity and courage she set aside the prejudices and opposition which were obstacles to my happiness, nor scrupled to give her hand, where she had given her heart."
He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.
"It was after one tremendous day when his eyes had glared on me like lightning and his voice sharp and broken seemed unable to express the extent of his emotion that in the evening when I was alone he joined me with a calm countenance, and not noticing my tears which I quickly dried when he approached, told me that in three days that sic he intended to remove with me to his estate in Yorkshire, and bidding me prepare left me hastily as if afraid of being questioned."
"Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys."
We spent two months together in this house.
"They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives."
"Morning broke; and the old woman saw the corpse, marked with the fatal disease, close to her; her wrist was livid with the hold loosened by death."
Perdita beheld with affright the encreasing disorder.
"Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter."
The position of the stars was my only guide.
"I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness."
"This circumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him."
I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener.
I gave him love only.
The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.
"After travelling day and night I arrived with an anxious, yet a hoping heart, for why should he send for me if it were only to avoid me and to treat me with the apparent aversion that he had in London."
"A beautiful creation, he would say, which may claim this superiority to its model, that good and evil is more easily seperated: the good rewarded in the way they themselves desire; the evil punished as all things evil ought to be punished, not by pain which is revolting to all philanthropy to consider but by quiet obscurity, which simply deprives them of their harmful qualities; why kill the serpent when you have extracted his fangs?"
"I heard the roar of the waters: he held his course right on towards the brink and I became breathless with fear lest he should plunge down the dreadful precipice; I tried to augment my speed, but my knees failed beneath me, yet I had just reached him; just caught a part of his flowing robe, when he leapt down and I awoke with a violent scream."
But at that moment a crash was heard.
"I could not see her thus lost, without exerting myself to remedy the evil remediless I knew, if I could not in the end bring her to reconcile herself to Raymond."
"The happy do not feel poverty for delight is as a gold tissued robe, and crowns them with priceless gems."
You are of this world; I am not.
"Remember that cleanliness, sobriety, and even good humour and benevolence, are our best medicines."""
There was a gentleman of small fortune who lived near his family mansion who had three lovely daughters.
"It was probable that the inmate was absent, but secure that he had found the right person, our adventurous Protector was tempted to enter, to leave a purse on the table, and silently depart."

This same evening his mother and sister arrived.
"This poor man, learned as La Place, guileless and unforeseeing as a child, had often been on the point of starvation, he, his pale wife and numerous offspring, while he neither felt hunger, nor observed distress."
The physician declared that he died of the plague.
"""I talk not of others, but myself,"" replied Raymond, ""and I am as fair an example to go by as another."
"The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise."
"He was younger, less worn, more passionless than my father and in no degree reminded me of him: he suffered under immediate grief yet its gentle influence instead of calling feelings otherwise dormant into action, seemed only to veil that which otherwise would have been too dazzling for me."
"By the application of praise, censure, and exhortation, she tried to seek and strike the fitting chords; and though the melody that followed her touch seemed discord to her, she built her hopes on his talents, and felt sure that she would at last win him."
"""When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings."
"On the contrary, the disease gained virulence, while starvation did its accustomed work."
"Pale and tearful, she almost forgot her duties as hostess; her eyes were fixed on her children."
"These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye."
"Is not short payne well borne that brings long ease, And lays the soul to sleep in quiet grave?F ""Do you mark my words; I have learned the language of despair: I have it all by heart, for I am Despair; and a strange being am I, joyous, triumphant Despair."
To part with what is a part of myself; without whom I have no memory and no futurity?
"""Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power."
"I followed her, and strove to inspire more hope than I could myself entertain; but she shook her head mournfully."
"But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it."
"I seized the favourable moment, and endeavoured to awaken in her something beyond the killing torpor of grief."
"""Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination."
"Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, ""What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?"
Idris endeavoured to calm Perdita; but the poor girl's agitation deprived her of all power of self command.
"""My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense."
"On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event."
"But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate."
"Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true."
"his own trusting, devoted, affectionate Perdita, whose generous belief galled him doubly, when he remembered the parade of innocence with which it had been exacted."
"He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command."
We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.
"Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?"""
Yet he would not propose the separation.
The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve.
"None but Adrian could have tamed the motley population of London, which, like a troop of unbitted steeds rushing to their pastures, had thrown aside all minor fears, through the operation of the fear paramount."
"But a few months have elapsed since I believed that I was all the world to you; and that there was no happiness or grief for you on earth unshared by your Mathilda your child: that happy time is no longer, and what I most dreaded in this world is come upon me."
"I had chosen night time for our journey to London, that the change and desolation of the country might be the less observable."
He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.
"My life was like that of an animal, and my mind was in danger of degenerating into that which informs brute nature."
"Who that knows what ""life"" is, would pine for this feverish species of existence?"
He asked for my sister; and I delivered her message.
"I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas."
"They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows."""
"""Do so, if you will; but I will not."
"He would forsake her, England, his friends, the scenes of his youth, the hopes of coming time, he would seek another country, and in other scenes begin life again."
"During the early part of my life there is little to relate, and I will be brief; but I must be allowed to dwell a little on the years of my childhood that it may be apparent how when one hope failed all life was to be a blank; and how when the only affection I was permitted to cherish was blasted my existence was extinguished with it."
None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.
"""As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast."
"I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing."
"My knowledge of the worldly principles of Lord Raymond, would have ever prevented me from applying to him, however deep my distress might have been."
"The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks."
"Even music was not wanting: banners floated in the air, and the shrill fife and loud trumpet breathed forth sounds of encouragement and victory."
To some among the poor this was matter of exultation.
A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.
All these circumstances were now related to Adrian and Idris.
Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?
"We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us."
"Languor was changed to ardour, the slow step converted to a speedy pace, while the hollow murmur of the multitude, inspired by one feeling, and that deadly, filled the air, drowning the clang of arms and sound of music."
The usual one of imports was entirely cut off.
"By the reigning God it is true; the paltry earldom of Windsor shall no longer content him, who will inherit the rights which must for ever appertain to the person who possesses it."
"And I, the nearest kinsman of the Earl of Windsor, was to propose his election."
"Return to Windsor then, my brother; for such you are by every tie fill the double place my absence imposes on you, and let me, in all my sufferings here, turn my eyes towards that dear seclusion, and say There is peace."""
Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.
"If it indeed be that; if the efforts of the virtuous now, are to make the future inhabitants of this fair world more happy; if the labours of those who cast aside selfishness, and try to know the truth of things, are to free the men of ages, now far distant but which will one day come, from the burthen under which those who now live groan, and like you weep bitterly; if they free them but from one of what are now the necessary evils of life, truly I will not fail but will with my whole soul aid the work."
A little population occupied its halls.
"When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, 'Good night sweet Safie.'"
"Indignation now transported him; his words I guessed were fraught with disdain then turning from his coward followers, he addressed himself to enter the city alone."
"Now I am the first man in the state, burthen of every ballad, and object of old women's mumbled devotions."
All the time she could command she spent in solitude.
"I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach."
"She never mentioned her father to Perdita, she appeared half afraid when she spoke of him to me, and though I tried to draw her out on the subject, and to dispel the gloom that hung about her ideas concerning him, I could not succeed."
"""But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva."
"In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain."
"Its pleasant places were deserted; its temples and palaces were converted into tombs; its energies, bent before towards the highest objects of human ambition, were now forced to converge to one point, the guarding against the innumerous arrows of the plague."
"Shall we, in these desart halls, under this wintry sky, sit with closed eyes and folded hands, expecting death?"
"My heart was full of deep affection, but it was calm from its very depth and fulness."
"Ryland was roused to resistance; he asserted that his sufferance alone had permitted the encrease of this party; but the time for indulgence was passed, and with one motion of his arm he would sweep away the cobwebs that blinded his countrymen."
"This, O this may be the last time that you will surround me thus"" Abruptly she stopped, and then cried: ""What have I said?"
"Our eldest in some degree understood the scenes passing around, and at times, he with serious looks questioned me concerning the reason of so vast a desolation."
"""You talk of the future,"" she said, ""while the present is all to me."
"The aristocratical party, the richest and most influential men in England, appeared less agitated than the others, for the question was to be discussed without their interference."
She understood my gesture; again her head fell; again her fingers worked restlessly.
"""My father left it Where is he?"
"Our change of cheer struck those nearest to us; and, by means of Ryland's servants, the report soon spread that he had fled from the plague in London."
"Anguish deprived her of presence of mind; she gave up to me and Clara the physician's and nurse's parts; she sat by the bed, holding one little burning hand, and, with glazed eyes fixed on her babe, passed the long day in one unvaried agony."
It soon became known that Adrian took great delight in his park and preserves.
"He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?"
"So true it is, that man's mind alone was the creator of all that was good or great to man, and that Nature herself was only his first minister."
"My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application."
"We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities."
"Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness."
As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.
"When the clouds veiled the sky, and the wind scattered them there and here, rending their woof, and strewing its fragments through the aerial plains then we rode out, and sought new spots of beauty and repose."
Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.
"To crown my vexation of spirit, Perdita, the visionary Perdita, seemed to awake to real life with transport, when she told me that the Earl of Windsor was about to arrive."
"All was uproar, crime, remorse and hate, yet still the tenderest love; and what first awoke me to the firm resolve of conquering my passion and of restoring her father to my child was the sight of your bitter and sympathizing sorrows."
"Perdita's questions had ceased; she leaned on my arm, panting with emotions too acute for tears our men pulled alongside the other boat."
"Tumult filled the before quiet streets women and children deserted their homes, escaping they knew not whither fathers, husbands, and sons, stood trembling, not for themselves, but for their loved and defenceless relations."
What is there in our nature that is for ever urging us on towards pain and misery?
"Although we were anxious to leave England before the depth of winter, yet we were detained."
"The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields."
I continued awe struck and mute he looked smilingly on the poor girl; the smile was his.
"I felt the beneficial result of such excitement, in a renewal of those pleasing flights of fancy to which I had long been a stranger."
"Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again."
Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.
"It was as the ass and the lap dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration."
The rain had ceased; there was no more thunder and lightning; the wind had paused.
It devolved on me to disclose our plan to Idris.
"Come, come, the worst is past: no more grief, tears or despair; were not those the words you uttered?"
Resentment added also a sting to my censure; and I reprobated Raymond's conduct in severe terms.
"Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise."
"I was awake, alive, while the brother of death possessed my race."
"We were interrupted by an attendant, who announced, that the staff of Raymond was assembled in the council chamber."
"He came up the while; and his appearance blew aside, with gentle western breath, my cloudy wrath: a tall, slim, fair boy, with a physiognomy expressive of the excess of sensibility and refinement stood before me; the morning sunbeams tinged with gold his silken hair, and spread light and glory over his beaming countenance."
"Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event."
I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.
"In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path."
"I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like."
"We will nominate Adrian, and do our best to bestow on him the power to which he is entitled by his birth, and which he merits through his virtues."
Deeper grief oppressed Perdita.
Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.
"In open ambition or close intrigue, his end was the same to attain the first station in his own country."
She never for a moment credited the story of his death; she resolved instantly to go to Greece.
"Raymond had lost much of his popularity, and was deserted by his peculiar partizans."
"But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time."
He did not conceive that ever qu.
Methought this was but a poor expedient; but I assured him of my obedience and zeal.
"""My cousin,"" replied I, ""it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape."
"He had a feeling that however they might express ridicule of his intended marriage they would not dare display it when it had taken place; therefore seeking the consent of his guardian which with some difficulty he obtained, and of the father of his mistress which was more easily given, without acquainting any one else of his intention, by the time he had attained his twentieth birthday he had become the husband of Diana."
"The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses."
"He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity."
"The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony."
"Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third."
"There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause."
"Thus untaught in refined philosophy, and pursued by a restless feeling of degradation from my true station in society, I wandered among the hills of civilized England as uncouth a savage as the wolf bred founder of old Rome."
But they became every day more ardent and tender.
"Suddenly one of the choristers died he was lifted from his desk, the vaults below were hastily opened he was consigned with a few muttered prayers to the darksome cavern, abode of thousands who had gone before now wide yawning to receive even all who fulfilled the funeral rites."
"Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.'"
"We all observed the visitation of these feelings, and none regretted them so much as Perdita."
For this reason I avoided this high born damsel.
"It was not till one of them died that he perceived their danger; one by one they were carried off by pestilence; and his wife, his helpmate and supporter, more necessary to him than his own limbs and frame, which had hardly been taught the lesson of self preservation, the kind companion whose voice always spoke peace to him, closed her eyes in death."
"The days that followed were full of pain to me; so that I sometimes regretted that I had not yielded at once to the haughty lady, who watched all my motions, and turned my beloved task of nursing my friend to a work of pain and irritation."
"Good God Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless."
"If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized."
"Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it thus Chapter I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic."
"I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn."
"The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors."
"At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress."
"""Did we form ourselves, choosing our dispositions, and our powers?"
"Clara, overcome by weariness, had seated herself at the foot of her cousin's bed, and in spite of her efforts slumber weighed down her lids; twice or thrice she shook it off; but at length she was conquered and slept."
"Her servant, however, remained with her."
The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet.
"He had her then removed to a more commodious dwelling, and hovered about her, again and again to assure himself that she was safe."
I now forget the cause of her departure if indeed I ever knew it.
"I clasped that kind hand; I tried to answer; a fervent ""God bless you"" was all my ignorance could frame of speech, and I darted away, oppressed by my new emotions."
"The acquisition of unknown languages was too tedious an occupation, for one who referred every expression to the universe within, and read not, as many do, for the mere sake of filling up time; but who was still questioning herself and her author, moulding every idea in a thousand ways, ardently desirous for the discovery of truth in every sentence."
"His passions were violent; as these often obtained the mastery over him, he could not always square his conduct to the obvious line of self interest, but self gratification at least was the paramount object with him."
"I wished to imitate his example, but men are used to move all together, if they move at all, and I could find no means of leading the inhabitants of scattered towns and villages, who forgot my words as soon as they heard them not, and veered with every baffling wind, that might arise from an apparent change of circumstance."
"Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick."

"By the utmost self violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice."
Chapter The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply.
"My manly virtues did not desert me, for the witch Urania spared the locks of Sampson, while he reposed at her feet; but all was softened and humanized."

He asked me the history of my earlier years.

"While he was yet undecided, she had quitted England; the news of his marriage reached her, and her hopes, poorly nurtured blossoms, withered and fell."
"The mere flow of animal spirits was Paradise, and at night's close I only desired a renewal of the intoxicating delusion."
"In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground."
"We discussed his chances, the merits of the other candidates, and the dispositions of the voters."
"The stinging ""remorse of love"" now pierced her heart."
"When she found herself forsaken by him, she lost the heart to pursue her usual avocations; pride forbade every application to him; famine was welcomed as the kind porter to the gates of death, within whose opening folds she should now, without sin, quickly repose."
Our house was the house of mourning.
Raymond questioned him; but his reserved answers soon made him turn from the man to the drawing.
"We must all remain; and do our best to help our suffering fellow creatures."""
Leave the task of persuasion on that point to me; I do not ask you to assist me there.
"And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?"
"He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited."
He was pacing the garden: his passions were in a state of inconceivable turbulence.
"He got over his grief for Elinor, and the country became dull to him, so he was glad to find even me for amusement; and when he does not know what else to do he passes his lazy hours here, and calls this friendship It is true that his presence is a consolation to me, and that his words are sweet, and, when he will he can pour forth thoughts that win me from despair."
"He was courteous, honey tongued an adept in fascinating arts."
"Yet I will not die; alas how dare I go where I may meet Diana, when I have disobeyed her last request; her last words said in a faint voice when all feeling but love, which survives all things else was already dead, she then bade me make her child happy: that thought alone gives a double sting to death."
"'Who are you?' ""At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered."
At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude.
"""That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years."
"He writhed beneath an injury he was unable to revenge; and he quitted England with a vow not to return, till the good time should arrive, when she might feel the power of him she now despised."
The Countess of Windsor was by nature full of energetic feeling; but she had very seldom in her life permitted the concentrated emotions of her heart to shew themselves on her features.
"Desire of renown, and presumptuous ambition, had characterized his youth."
"They seemed full of careful thought, and a few words of their conversation that reached me, induced me to approach and make further enquiries."

All Athens accompanied us for several miles.
I can speak for myself want of energy was not my failing.
"With the energy natural to her, Perdita then endeavoured to supply his place."
"The busy eastern part of the town was silent, or at most you saw only where, half from cupidity, half from curiosity, the warehouses had been more ransacked than pillaged: bales of rich India goods, shawls of price, jewels, and spices, unpacked, strewed the floors."
"I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable."
"We were alone together; the sun had set; the song of the nightingales began; the evening star shone distinct in the flood of light, which was yet unfaded in the west."
"The tent of the Arab is fallen in the sands, and his horse spurns the ground unbridled and unsaddled."

"""This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that."
Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.
"I cannot number the birds that I have saved during the long and severe winters of that climate; or the hares and rabbits that I have defended from the attacks of our dogs, or have nursed when accidentally wounded."

"The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags."
But that could not be.
"His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering."
"If dishonour, or what I conceive to be dishonour, come near me, I am lost."""
"""Since you have preserved my narration,"" said he, ""I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity."""
Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
"I see the desolate plain covered with white, save a few black patches that the noonday sun has made at the top of those sharp pointed hillocks from which the snow, sliding as it fell, lay thinner than on the plain ground: a few birds are pecking at the hard ice that covers the pools for the frost has been of long continuance."
"Mocking her own desires, she rallied her guests on their early departure."
We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.
"The details contained in the foregoing pages, apparently trivial, yet each slightest one weighing like lead in the depressed scale of human afflictions; this tedious dwelling on the sorrows of others, while my own were only in apprehension; this slowly laying bare of my soul's wounds: this journal of death; this long drawn and tortuous path, leading to the ocean of countless tears, awakens me again to keen grief."
"Every motive, every threat, every angry taunt was urged in vain."
"""The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun."
"From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart moving indications of impending famine disappeared."
"He was gay, playful, fascinating but never did he overstep the modesty of nature, or the respect due to himself, in his wildest sallies."
"Yet perhaps I shall not be too late."""
"This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress."

When I was twelve years old it occurred to my aunt that I ought to learn music; she herself played upon the harp.
"Diotima approached the fountain seated herself on a mossy mound near it and her disciples placed themselves on the grass near her Without noticing me who sat close under her she continued her discourse addressing as it happened one or other of her listeners but before I attempt to repeat her words I will describe the chief of these whom she appeared to wish principally to impress One was a woman of about years of age in the full enjoyment of the most exquisite beauty her golden hair floated in ringlets on her shoulders her hazle eyes were shaded by heavy lids and her mouth the lips apart seemed to breathe sensibility But she appeared thoughtful unhappy her cheek was pale she seemed as if accustomed to suffer and as if the lessons she now heard were the only words of wisdom to which she had ever listened The youth beside her had a far different aspect his form was emaciated nearly to a shadow his features were handsome but thin worn his eyes glistened as if animating the visage of decay his forehead was expansive but there was a doubt perplexity in his looks that seemed to say that although he had sought wisdom he had got entangled in some mysterious mazes from which he in vain endeavoured to extricate himself As Diotima spoke his colour went came with quick changes the flexible muscles of his countenance shewed every impression that his mind received he seemed one who in life had studied hard but whose feeble frame sunk beneath the weight of the mere exertion of life the spark of intelligence burned with uncommon strength within him but that of life seemed ever on the eve of fading At present I shall not describe any other of this groupe but with deep attention try to recall in my memory some of the words of Diotima they were words of fire but their path is faintly marked on my recollection It requires a just hand, said she continuing her discourse, to weigh divide the good from evil On the earth they are inextricably entangled and if you would cast away what there appears an evil a multitude of beneficial causes or effects cling to it mock your labour When I was on earth and have walked in a solitary country during the silence of night have beheld the multitude of stars, the soft radiance of the moon reflected on the sea, which was studded by lovely islands When I have felt the soft breeze steal across my cheek as the words of love it has soothed cherished me then my mind seemed almost to quit the body that confined it to the earth with a quick mental sense to mingle with the scene that I hardly saw I felt Then I have exclaimed, oh world how beautiful thou art Oh brightest universe behold thy worshiper spirit of beauty of sympathy which pervades all things, now lifts my soul as with wings, how have you animated the light the breezes Deep inexplicable spirit give me words to express my adoration; my mind is hurried away but with language I cannot tell how I feel thy loveliness Silence or the song of the nightingale the momentary apparition of some bird that flies quietly past all seems animated with thee more than all the deep sky studded with worlds"" If the winds roared tore the sea and the dreadful lightnings seemed falling around me still love was mingled with the sacred terror I felt; the majesty of loveliness was deeply impressed on me So also I have felt when I have seen a lovely countenance or heard solemn music or the eloquence of divine wisdom flowing from the lips of one of its worshippers a lovely animal or even the graceful undulations of trees inanimate objects have excited in me the same deep feeling of love beauty; a feeling which while it made me alive eager to seek the cause animator of the scene, yet satisfied me by its very depth as if I had already found the solution to my enquires sic as if in feeling myself a part of the great whole I had found the truth secret of the universe But when retired in my cell I have studied contemplated the various motions and actions in the world the weight of evil has confounded me If I thought of the creation I saw an eternal chain of evil linked one to the other from the great whale who in the sea swallows destroys multitudes the smaller fish that live on him also torment him to madness to the cat whose pleasure it is to torment her prey I saw the whole creation filled with pain each creature seems to exist through the misery of another death havoc is the watchword of the animated world And Man also even in Athens the most civilized spot on the earth what a multitude of mean passions envy, malice a restless desire to depreciate all that was great and good did I see And in the dominions of the great being I saw man reduced?"
"The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance."
"He would talk of the wonderful powers of man, of their present state and of their hopes: of what they had been and what they were, and when reason could no longer guide him, his imagination as if inspired shed light on the obscurity that veils the past and the future."
"I will not be put off thus: do you think that I can live thus fearfully from day to day the sword in my bosom yet kept from its mortal wound by a hair a word I demand that dreadful word; though it be as a flash of lightning to destroy me, speak it."
Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.
"Unsupported and weak, let him wander through fields where the unreaped corn stands in barren plenty, through copses planted by his fathers, through towns built for his use."
This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.
"All the time he had passed out of England was as a dream, and all the interest of his soul, all his affections belonged to events which had happened and persons who had existed sixteen years before."

"I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot."
"The benches were very empty, those by custom occupied by the hereditary members were vacant; the city members were there the members for the commercial towns, few landed proprietors, and not many of those who entered parliament for the sake of a career."
"""To morrow,"" said Raymond, ""his mother and sister set out for Scotland to see him once again."""
"You are cast out shelterless on the world: your hopes are blasted; the peace and security of your pure mind destroyed; memory will bring to you frightful images of guilt, and the anguish of innocent love betrayed."
"Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death Nor were these my only visions."
"For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence."
"As I spoke, my subject carried me away; deep admiration; grief, the offspring of truest affection, the overflowing of a heart bursting with sympathy for all that had been great and sublime in the career of my friend, inspired me as I poured forth the praises of Raymond."
"Such a violet was sweet Perdita, trembling to entrust herself to the very air, cowering from observation, yet betrayed by her excellences; and repaying with a thousand graces the labour of those who sought her in her lonely bye path."
"""The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of Empires."
"Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England."
"But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound."
"She fed even to tears of joy on the praise and glory of her Lord; her whole existence was one sacrifice to him, and if in the humility of her heart she felt self complacency, it arose from the reflection that she had won the distinguished hero of the age, and had for years preserved him, even after time had taken from love its usual nourishment."
"Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him."
They were fond of the sweet orphan.
"The breeze scattered the grey locks on his temples, the rain drenched his uncovered head, he sat hiding his face in his withered hands."
"With all the incongruities of his character, Raymond was emphatically a man of the world."
He looked round timidly; a mist seemed before his eyes.
He perpetually frequented the walks that had been favourites with him when he and my mother wandered together talking of love and happiness; he collected every relick that remained of her and always sat opposite her picture which hung in the room fixing on it a look of sad despair and all this was done in a mystic and awful silence.
They left me happy how unspeakably happy.

"You are very young; let not this check for more than a moment retard your glorious course; hold on, beloved one."
Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance.
"""It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth."""
The presence of a friend in its armies and councils made us enter into the details with enthusiasm; and a short letter now and then from Raymond told us how he was engrossed by the interests of his adopted country.
"Chapter We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to commence."
"""A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours."
The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair.

"On the present occasion she did not suspect any alienation of affection; but she conjectured that some circumstance connected with his high place, had occasioned this mystery."
"Thus I stood upon a pinnacle, a sea of evil rolled at my feet; I was about to precipitate myself into it, and rush like a torrent over all obstructions to the object of my wishes when a stranger influence came over the current of my fortunes, and changed their boisterous course to what was in comparison like the gentle meanderings of a meadow encircling streamlet."
"Winter was hailed, a general and never failing physician."

"I was a poor, uneducated, unbefriended, mountain girl, raised from nothingness by him."
"Who has not seen the lightsome earth, the balmy atmosphere, and basking nature become dark, cold and ungenial, when the sleeping wind has awoke in the east?"
"I did not accuse Evadne of hypocrisy or a wish to deceive her lover; but the first letter that I saw of hers convinced me that she did not love him; it was written with elegance, and, foreigner as she was, with great command of language."
"In all our transactions with him our honour must be inviolate, the integrity of our relations untainted: fate and circumstance may, when he arrives at maturity, separate us for ever but, as his aegis in danger, his consolation in hardship, let the ardent youth for ever bear with him through the rough path of life, love and honour for his parents."
Raymond had been exalted by the determination he had made; but with the declining day his spirits declined.
A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.
"She seemed to have formed his mind of that excellence which no dross can tarnish, and his understanding was such that no error could pervert."

"A party of people flying from London, as was frequent in those days, had come up the Thames in a boat."
"There was an air of anxiety, sometimes of terror in the new comers, strongly contrasted with the resigned and even satisfied mien of those who had had audience."
"The powerful and unjust cowered at the steps of your judgment seat, and the poor and oppressed arose like morn awakened flowers under the sunshine of your protection."
"Nay, more, that this aspiring noble revived the claim of the house of Windsor to the crown, and that, on the event of Adrian's incurable disorder and his marriage with the sister, the brow of the ambitious Raymond might be encircled with the magic ring of regality."
"He betook himself to books with ardour, and reposed from study in the society he best loved, that of his sister and myself."
"At first he did not recur to the past, or indeed to any personal occurrences."
"Each night I returned to the Castle, and found there repose and love awaiting me."
"Rome, and Florence, and Pisa were overflowed, and their marble palaces, late mirrored in tranquil streams, had their foundations shaken by their winter gifted power."
"Poor and rich were now equal, or rather the poor were the superior, since they entered on such tasks with alacrity and experience; while ignorance, inaptitude, and habits of repose, rendered them fatiguing to the luxurious, galling to the proud, disgustful to all whose minds, bent on intellectual improvement, held it their dearest privilege to be exempt from attending to mere animal wants."
"""How cold and damp your hand is,"" said her friend; ""you are over fatigued, pray hasten to rest."""
"In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month."
"I had ridiculed the fears of my countrymen, when they related to others; now that they came home to myself, I paused."
I was overcome by weariness; the solitude depressed my spirits.
"Others made long journies to unite themselves to those they loved, and arrived to find them dead."
"""This is what it is to live,"" he cried; ""how I enjoy existence But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful"" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine."
"""Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you."""
"That he should know of our existence, and treat us, near at hand, with the same contumely which his father had practised in distance and absence, appeared to me the certain consequence of all that had gone before."
"I had watched this scene, for there was a gentleness about the poor woman that interested me; she now tottered away from the door, walking as well as she could down Holborn Hill; but her strength soon failed her; she leaned against a wall, and her head sunk on her bosom, while her pallid cheek became still more white."
Our minds embrace infinity; the visible mechanism of our being is subject to merest accident.
"""Happy are dreamers,"" he continued, ""so that they be not awakened Would I could dream but 'broad and garish day' is the element in which I live; the dazzling glare of reality inverts the scene for me."
"The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country."
"All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell."
"Farewell, Frankenstein If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction."
"When we had parted, I had clasped her to my bosom with unrestrained warmth; we met again, and new feelings were awakened; when each beheld the other, childhood passed, as full grown actors on this changeful scene."
"To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death."
"Nay, she seemed to wish to distract my thoughts from the subject: she rose from the floor: ""Hush"" she said, whisperingly; ""after much weeping, Clara sleeps; we must not disturb her."""
"Unaccustomed to industry, he knew not in what way to contribute to the support of his increasing family."
This news precipitated me from my self raised pinnacle of honour.
"Loss of property, hopelessness as to his future prospects, the inoccupation to which poverty condemned him, combined to reduce him to a state bordering on insanity."
At that instant my father entered.
"Unable to support the slow withering of her hopes, she suddenly formed a plan, resolving to terminate at once the period of misery, and to bring to an happy conclusion the late disastrous events."
"If a feeling of dissatisfaction ever crossed her, it arose from the idea that he was not perfectly happy."
"Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?"
"Medical aid was less easily procured, food was more difficult to obtain, and human beings, unwithheld by shame, for they were unbeheld of their fellows, ventured on deeds of greater wickedness, or gave way more readily to their abject fears."
"Monster as I am, you are still, as you ever were, lovely, beautiful beyond expression."
"My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another."
"The time when in proud and happy security we assembled at this cottage, was gone soon the present hours would join those past, and shadows of future ones rose dark and menacing from the womb of time, their cradle and their bier."
"But they tell us that the curse of God is on the place, for every one who has ventured within the walls has been tainted by the plague; that this disease has spread in Thrace and Macedonia; and now, fearing the virulence of infection during the coming heats, a cordon has been drawn on the frontiers of Thessaly, and a strict quarantine exacted."""
"The weather was temperate; soft rains fell at night, and by day the wintry sun shone out."

"When in company, sadness would in spite of every effort steal over his features, and he sat absent and mute among the busy crowd that thronged about him."
"""Oh, Justine"" said she. ""Why did you rob me of my last consolation?"
"The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove."
I rambled away from them.
"When it seemed destined that all were to die, we were reckless of the how and when now that the virulence of the disease was mitigated, and it appeared willing to spare some, each was eager to be among the elect, and clung to life with dastard tenacity."
"I saw Raymond's coal black charger brought to the palace gate; a small company of officers arrived soon after; care and fear was painted on each cheek, and in each eye, unrefreshed by sleep."
"Perdita would not enter Athens; but reposing at Marathon on the night of our arrival, conducted me on the following day, to the spot selected by her as the treasure house of Raymond's dear remains."
"Time shall rob me of the graces of maturity, shall take the fire from my eyes, and agility from my limbs, shall steal the better part of life, eager expectation and passionate love, and shower them in double portion on thy dear head."
"I scrambled on, until I came to a street, whose wooden houses, half burnt, had been cooled by the rain, and were fortunately uninjured by the gunpowder."
"She was like a fruitful soil that imbibed the airs and dews of heaven, and gave them forth again to light in loveliest forms of fruits and flowers; but then she was often dark and rugged as that soil, raked up, and new sown with unseen seed."
"Do you, my compassionate friend, tell me how to die peacefully and innocently and I will bless you: all that I, poor wretch, can desire is a painless death."""
Perdita did not oppose herself to his determination.
I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.
"I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs?"
"This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends."
"Idris leaned back in the carriage; her two hands pressed mine, her countenance was placid, she seemed to lose the sense of what she now left, in the memory of what she still possessed."
As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.
"After watching over and providing for their safety, her second care was to hide from me her anguish and tears."
"My child, if after this life I am permitted to see you again, if pain can purify the heart, mine will be pure: if remorse may expiate guilt, I shall be guiltless."
Does not the sun call in his light?
"When we arrived at Rodosto, we found that the field had been taken, and the scheme of the battle arranged."
He left college on this event and shaking off for a while his old friends he retired to the neighbourhood of his Diana and received all his consolation from her sweet voice and dearer caresses.
"The first subject that occupied the attention of the house was an address from the Lord Protector, praying them to appoint a deputy during a necessary absence on his part."
"The noisy joy of the populace, the gaudy colours of their dress, the tumult of carriages and horses, the march of soldiers intermixed, the waving of banners and sound of martial music added to the high excitement of the scene; while round us reposed in solemn majesty the relics of antient time."
"But then my plan must be laid with art; I would not be left destitute, I must secure some money."
"I committed the remains of my lost Perdita to his care, for the purpose of having them transported to Hymettus, and placed in the cell her Raymond already occupied beneath the pyramid."
"Evadne did not answer; her large dark eyes were cast down, at length a tear glimmered on the lashes."
"I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return."
"No one at Windsor would afford them shelter; so, going a little further up, they remained all night in a deserted hut near Bolter's lock."
"The young people, the Etonians, and children of the neighbouring gentry, held a mock fair, to which all the country people were invited."
"The Countess cast no look of kindness on my worn out frame, though afterwards she thanked me coldly for my attentions."
Yet I am certainly unjust.
"""Have you,"" he said, ""really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"""
Nor was it I alone who felt thus intimately his perfections.
"Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house."

"After a residence of about a year at Ulswater, Adrian visited London, and came back full of plans for our benefit."

"The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended."
"Encouraged by this encomium, I proceeded, in answer to his inquiries, to relate what I remembered of my parent; and he gave an account of those circumstances which had brought about a neglect of my father's testamentary letter."
This idea was intolerably painful to him.
"No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air."
"The veil must be thicker than that invented by Turkish jealousy; the wall higher than the unscaleable tower of Vathek, which should conceal from her the workings of his heart, and hide from her view the secret of his actions."
"When I had ceased to weep reason and memory returned upon me, and I began to reflect with greater calmness on what had happened, and how it became me to act A few hours only had passed but a mighty revolution had taken place with regard to me the natural work of years had been transacted since the morning: my father was as dead to me, and I felt for a moment as if he with white hairs were laid in his coffin and I youth vanished in approaching age, were weeping at his timely dissolution."
"I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?"
"Might he not many, many years hence, when age had quenched the burning sensations that he now experienced, might he not then be again a father to me?"
"When the fever of my young life is spent; when placid age shall tame the vulture that devours me, friendship may come, love and hope being dead."
I cannot say with what passion I loved every thing even the inanimate objects that surrounded me.
It became a question whether he had fallen among the unrecognized; but no broken ornament or stained trapping betrayed his fate.
"He was seldom at the palace; never, but when he was assured that his public duties would prevent his remaining alone with Perdita."
"He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation."

These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.
"I continued: ""This poor wretch is deserted, dying, succourless; in these unhappy times, God knows how soon any or all of us may be in like want."
I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.
"His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, ""To seek one who fled from me."" ""And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"""
"And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?"
"The king, who was a man of excellent dispositions, but easily led, had now become a willing disciple of his imperious consort."
Was the coming painful?
"""I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge."
"One sheet of white covered it, while bitter recollection told me that cold as the winter clothed earth, were the hearts of the inhabitants."
"They looked at the pictures, strolled into the other apartments, talked of billiards, and one by one vanished."
"When I awoke it rained: I was already quite wet, and my limbs were stiff and my head giddy with the chill of night."
"How kind, how very kind But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?"" My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence."
"What had been hardly won, was now, entirely possessed, doubly dear."
They left me in an hour's time.
"Through long habit they had become a part of himself; his want of worldly knowledge, his absence of mind and infant guilelessness, made him utterly dependent on them."
"I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight."
"All the genius that ennobled the blood of her father illustrated hers; a generous tide flowed in her veins; artifice, envy, or meanness, were at the antipodes of her nature; her countenance, when enlightened by amiable feeling, might have belonged to a queen of nations; her eyes were bright; her look fearless."
From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.
"But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health."
She now took pleasure in my society; towards Idris she felt and displayed a full and affectionate sense of her worth she restored to her child in abundant measure her tenderness and care.
"I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured."
"As manhood dawned upon him, his schemes and theories, far from being changed by personal and prudential motives, acquired new strength from the powers he felt arise within him; and his love for Evadne became deep rooted, as he each day became more certain that the path he pursued was full of difficulty, and that he must seek his reward, not in the applause or gratitude of his fellow creatures, hardly in the success of his plans, but in the approbation of his own heart, and in her love and sympathy, which was to lighten every toil and recompence every sacrifice."
"""My brother,"" she cried, ""protector of my childhood, dear, most dear Lionel, my fate hangs by a thread."
Yet active life was the genuine soil for his virtues; and he sometimes suffered tedium from the monotonous succession of events in our retirement.
"I hastily gave my consent to this arrangement, and as hastily formed a plan through which Perdita should be forced to become my companion."
"I no longer exhaust my miserable heart by bitter tears and frantic complaints; I no longer the sic reproach the sun, the earth, the air, for pain and wretchedness."
"The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me."
"The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene."
In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.
"The pomp of rank, the assumption of power, the possessions of wealth vanished like morning mist."
This action of Adrian provoked me.
"""When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country."
"But we must live, and not act our lives; pursuing the shadow, I lost the reality now I renounce both."
"Well, we removed to London, and still I felt only the peace of sinless passion."
"What is it you fear?"" ""Oh Peace, peace, my love,"" replied I; ""this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful."""
"Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor."
"The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me."
"Adrian was on horseback; he rode up to the carriage, and his gaiety, in addition to that of Raymond, dispelled my sister's melancholy."
"Were your sister indeed the insignificant person she deserves to be, I would willingly leave her to the fate, the wretched fate, of the wife of a man, whose very person, resembling as it does his wretched father, ought to remind you of the folly and vice it typifies but remember, Lady Idris, it is not alone the once royal blood of England that colours your veins, you are a Princess of Austria, and every life drop is akin to emperors and kings."
No delay was to ensue.
"Again she looked at the ring, it was a small ruby, almost heart shaped, which she had herself given him."
"The season was May, the weather stormless; we were promised a prosperous voyage."
He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.
"It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood."
The sprightly parties broke up they assembled in whispering groups.
My affections were human; hope and love were the day stars of my life.
"Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him."
"He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding."
"With an heavy heart I entered the palace, and stood fearful to advance, to speak, to look."
"Often all sounds were suspended, that we might listen to the nightingale, while the fire flies danced in bright measure, and the soft cooing of the aziolo spoke of fair weather to the travellers."
"But, if you are seen thus strangely circumstanced, dear Idris, even now your enemies may learn your flight too soon: were it not better that I hired the chaise alone?"
Our friend resolved however not to be foiled in his wish.
My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.
In a moment she was in his arms.
"I dare not hope that I have inspired you with sufficient interest that the thought of me, and the affection that I shall ever bear you, will soften your melancholy and decrease the bitterness of your tears."
"During our stay at Naples, we often returned to this cave, sometimes alone, skimming the sun lit sea, and each time added to our store."
"""Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors."
"The glare of flames attested the progress of destruction, while, during mingled light and obscurity, the piles around me took gigantic proportions and weird shapes."
"It was spacious, and nearly circular, with a raised seat of stone, about the size of a Grecian couch, at one end."
Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?
"A slight circumstance induced me to alter my usual route, and to return home by Egham and Bishopgate."
"You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature."
"I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me."
"The christians sought their churches, christian maidens, even at the feast of roses, clad in white, with shining veils, sought, in long procession, the places consecrated to their religion, filling the air with their hymns; while, ever and anon, from the lips of some poor mourner in the crowd, a voice of wailing burst, and the rest looked up, fancying they could discern the sweeping wings of angels, who passed over the earth, lamenting the disasters about to fall on man."
"But the main substance rests on the truths contained in these poetic rhapsodies, and the divine intuition which the Cumaean damsel obtained from heaven."
"The reproaches which agony extorted; or worse, cureless, uncomplaining depression, when his mind was sunk in a torpor, not the less painful because it was silent and moveless."
"Cherishing the most fervent hopes, embarked on the waste ocean, we saw with delight the receding shore of Britain, and on the wings of desire outspeeded our well filled sails towards the South."
Our prime festivals were held in Perdita's cottage; nor were we ever weary of talking of the past or dreaming of the future.
The vacuity his heart endured of any deep interest in life during his long absence from his native country had had a singular effect upon his ideas.
I am in a strange state of mind.
"I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years."
"This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever."
"Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix."
"The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud."
"Women bear with resignation these long drawn ills, but to a man's impatient spirit, the slow motion of our cavalcade, the melancholy repose we took at noon, the perpetual presence of the pall, gorgeous though it was, that wrapt the rifled casket which had contained Raymond, the monotonous recurrence of day and night, unvaried by hope or change, all the circumstances of our march were intolerable."
"Besides, I wish at once to tell you my wishes and expectations, and then never again to revert to so painful a subject."
I called him my friend but I viewed all he did with jealous eyes.
"When unopposed they spread their ravages wide; in cases of danger they clustered, and by dint of numbers overthrew their weak and despairing foes."
"While Merrival was talking, Clara softly opened a door behind Idris, and beckoned me to come with a gesture and look of grief."
"We go on, each thought linked to the one which was its parent, each act to a previous act."
"When he had landed a month ago, the noisy populace had been hushed by sorrow and fear; but this was a festival day to all."
"""The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest."
"Ashy pale, Raymond and Perdita sat apart, looking on with sad smiles."
"Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel."
"""Last Thursday May th, I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais."
"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes."

"I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day."
"But this account, which might as properly belong to a former period of my life as to the present moment, leads me far afield."
"I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise."
"For a moment the poor girl fancied that her mother believed that she had drank poison: she was on the point of springing up; when the Countess, already at a distance from the bed, spoke in a low voice to her companion, and again Idris listened: ""Hasten,"" said she, ""there is no time to lose it is long past eleven; they will be here at five; take merely the clothes necessary for her journey, and her jewel casket."""
This determination soothed me.
"The plague was not in London alone, it was every where it came on us, as Ryland had said, like a thousand packs of wolves, howling through the winter night, gaunt and fierce."
"But like all other gifts of the Creator to Man, she is mortal; her life has attained its last hour."
"We talked of change and active pursuits, but still remained at Windsor, incapable of violating the charm that attached us to our secluded life."
"My imagination hung upon the scene of recognition; his miniature, which I should continually wear exposed on my breast, would be the means and I imaged the moment to my mind a thousand and a thousand times, perpetually varying the circumstances."
"We were all equal now; magnificent dwellings, luxurious carpets, and beds of down, were afforded to all."
I cannot rule myself.
"Having effected the reunion of Raymond and Perdita, I was eager to return to England; but his earnest request, added to awakening curiosity, and an indefinable anxiety to behold the catastrophe, now apparently at hand, in the long drawn history of Grecian and Turkish warfare, induced me to consent to prolong until the autumn, the period of my residence in Greece."
"When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied."
"But, at this period, the whole scheme of my existence was about to change."
"Above, the leaves of the beech wood cast a flickering shadow on his face, and waved in mournful melody over him I saw all these things and said, ""Aye, this is his grave"" And then I wept aloud, and raised my eyes to heaven to entreat for a respite to my despair and an alleviation for his unnatural suffering the tears that gushed in a warm healing stream from my eyes relieved the burthen that oppressed my heart almost to madness."
"This was the first commencement of my friendship with Adrian, and I must commemorate this day as the most fortunate of my life."
No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.
"Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms."
"Yet none of the defaced human forms which I distinguished, could be Raymond; so I turned my eyes away, while my heart sickened within me."
"As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me."
"A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me."
There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.
"I am about to leave thee; soon this living spirit which is ever busy among strange shapes and ideas, which belong not to thee, soon it will have flown to other regions and this emaciated body will rest insensate on thy bosom ""Rolled round in earth's diurnal course With rocks, and stones, and trees."
"I will put you in safety meanwhile, and return to you immediately."""
"He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise."
How shall I relate the catastrophe to so much joy; but the earth would not be the earth it is covered with blight and sorrow if one such pair as these angelic creatures had been suffered to exist for one another: search through the world and you will not find the perfect happiness which their marriage would have caused them to enjoy; there must have been a revolution in the order of things as established among us miserable earth dwellers to have admitted of such consummate joy.
"These feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair."
What do you demand of your captain?
"Take care of her and cherish her: one day I may claim her at your hands; but futurity is dark, make the present happy to her."" My father remained three months at Hamburgh; when he quitted it he changed his name, my aunt could never discover that which he adopted and only by faint hints, could conjecture that he had taken the road of Germany and Hungary to Turkey."
"A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health."
"I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success."
I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.
But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.
"Our native oak, as his partisans called him, was visited truly by a nipping winter."
"Her head fell on his shoulder, she trembled, alternate changes of fire and ice ran through her limbs: observing her emotion he spoke with softened accents: ""The blow is given."
"It was now deep winter; it had snowed, and was still snowing; the wind whistled in the leafless trees, despoiling them of the white flakes as they fell; its drear moaning, and the continued knocking, mingled wildly with my dreams at length I was wide awake; hastily dressing myself, I hurried to discover the cause of this disturbance, and to open my door to the unexpected visitor."
I feel death to be near at hand and I am calm.
"Miracles were to be wrought in my favour, the machine of social life pushed with vast effort backward."
"Present her with a mirror, in which she may know herself; and, when she is an adept in that necessary but difficult science, she will wonder at her present mistake, and hasten to restore to me, what is by right mine, her forgiveness, her kind thoughts, her love."""
"We will all make it our first care, our dearest task, to contribute to your happiness."""
"After trying vainly to enter the other apartments, he perceived just within the threshold of this one, a pair of small Turkish slippers; the door was ajar, but all was silent within."
"Less wonder far is it, that the garrison, despairing of being able to hold out longer, should take advantage of the negligence of our fleet to escape at once from siege and capture."
I have now mentioned all my studies.
They are gone for ever great as my power is I cannot recall them to you if indeed I wave my wand over you you will fancy that you feel their gentle spirits in the soft air that steals over your cheeks the distant sound of winds waters may image to you their voices which will bid you rejoice for that they live This will not take away your grief but you will shed sweeter tears than those which full of anguish hopelessness now start from your eyes This I can do also can I take you to see many of my provinces my fairy lands which you have not yet visited and whose beauty will while away the heavy time I have many lovely spots under my command which poets of old have visited and have seen those sights the relation of which has been as a revelation to the world many spots I have still in keeping of lovely fields or horrid rocks peopled by the beautiful or the tremendous which I keep in reserve for my future worshippers to one of those whose grim terrors frightened sleep from the eye I formerly led you but you now need more pleasing images although I will not promise you to shew you any new scenes yet if I lead you to one often visited by my followers you will at least see new combinations that will sooth if they do not delight you Follow me Alas I replied when have you found me slow to obey your voice some times indeed I have called you you have not come but when before have I not followed your slightest sign and have left what was either of joy or sorrow in our world to dwell with you in yours till you have dismissed me ever unwilling to depart But now the weight of grief that oppresses me takes from me that lightness which is necessary to follow your quick winged motions alas in the midst of my course one thought would make me droop to the ground while you would outspeed me to your Kingdom of Glory leave me here darkling Ungrateful replied the Spirit Do I not tell you that I will sustain console you My wings shall aid your heavy steps I will command my winds to disperse the mist that over casts you I will lead you to a place where you will not hear laughter that disturbs you or see the sun that dazzles you We will choose some of the most sombre walks of the Elysian fields The Elysian fields I exclaimed with a quick scream shall I then see?
What evil might not happen in the mean time?
"""Nay,"" said my companion, ""I can free you from your present impediment."
"The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends."
Thus although she appeared to be less initiated in the mysteries of life and society than he her knowledge was of a deeper kind and laid on firmer foundations; and if even her beauty and sweetness had not fascinated him her understanding would ever have held his in thrall.
Are these circumstances not dreadful?
"Yet I thank God that I have lived I thank God, that I have beheld his throne, the heavens, and earth, his footstool."
"Thousands died unlamented; for beside the yet warm corpse the mourner was stretched, made mute by death."
My rashness gave the victory in this dreadful fight to the enemy who triumphed over him as he lay fallen and vanquished.
"Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat."
"Look in that mirror; when I came your brow was contracted, your eyes deep sunk in your head, your lips quivering; your hands trembled violently when I took them; but now all is tranquil and soft."
"""'They are kind they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me."
A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.
He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.
"As you honour me as you worship God, in whose image those also are created as your children and friends are dear to you, shed not a drop of precious human blood."""
These motives urged me to comply with his demand.
"The merry marriage bells rung in my ears; I heard the nation's gratulation which followed the union; the ambitious noble uprose with swift eagle flight, from the lowly ground to regal supremacy and to the love of Idris."
"Compassion swelled his breast; he would see her once again; he would devise some plan for restoring her to society, and the enjoyment of her rank; their separation would then follow, as a matter of course."
"Her mind was of uncommon strength; she could subdue her sensible wants to her mental wishes, and suffer cold, hunger and misery, rather than concede to fortune a contested point."
"I beseech you; by your former love for me now lost, I adjure you to answer that one question."
"""Lionel, you hear: witness for me: persuade your sister to forgive the injury I have done her; persuade her to be mine."""
"Dear Victor, banish these dark passions."
"If I lift up my eyes and see the desart earth, and feel that those dear eyes have spent their mortal lustre, and that those beauteous lips are silent, their ""crimson leaves"" faded, for ever I am mute But you live, my Idris, even now you move before me There was a glade, O reader a grassy opening in the wood; the retiring trees left its velvet expanse as a temple for love; the silver Thames bounded it on one side, and a willow bending down dipt in the water its Naiad hair, dishevelled by the wind's viewless hand."
"He heard my account of the self dissolution of the army with calmness, and then said, ""You know, Verney, my fixed determination not to quit this place, until in the light of day Stamboul is confessedly ours."
"I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man."
"We saw a great deal of society, and no day passed that my father did not endeavour to embellish by some new enjoyment."
"None had ever before suspected, that power, or the suffrage of the many, could in any manner become dear to him."
"He entered the churches, and foretold to the congregations their speedy removal to the vaults below."
I know not what we are to hope; but there is some good beyond us that we must seek; and that is our earthly task.
There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
"An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast."
"She was submissive to those who held authority over her, but a perpetual cloud dwelt on her brow; she looked as if she expected enmity from every one who approached her, and her actions were instigated by the same feeling."
"I, the offspring of love, the child of the woods, the nursling of Nature's bright self was to submit to this?"
"It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city."
"Perdita had arrived with her child at Dartford, weeping and inconsolable."
"Again and again I have passed over in my remembrance the different scenes of my short life: if the world is a stage and I merely an actor on it my part has been strange, and, alas tragical."
"If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind."
"In his desire to repair his first losses, my father risked double stakes, and thus incurred a debt of honour he was wholly unable to pay."
"""There is more of what is specious than true in your distinction,"" said my companion."
Does not the plague rage each year in Stamboul?
"""All things go on,"" thought Perdita, ""all things proceed, decay, and perish When noontide has passed, and the weary day has driven her team to their western stalls, the fires of heaven rise from the East, moving in their accustomed path, they ascend and descend the skiey hill."
The latter feeling now predominated.
But there was no remedy.
This short seperation from his companions gave him courage to assert his independance.
"But frost would come at last, and with it a renewal of our lease of earth."
Raymond was actuated by far other feelings.
"At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God I have murdered my darling child' ""She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty."
"""It is not from deck,"" said the man at the helm, ""something has been thrown from the aft cabin."""
"Earth is to me a tomb, the firmament a vault, shrouding mere corruption."

"I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine."
Oh Sun how beautiful thou art And how glorious is the golden ocean that receives thee My heart is at peace I feel no sorrow a holy love stills my senses I feel as if my mind also partook of the inexpressible loveliness of surrounding nature What shall I do?
His favourite horse was found grazing by the margin of the tranquil river.
"In his solitary despair Adrian would often seek my sister, and in covered terms express his misery, while fortitude and agony divided the throne of his mind."
But then Perdita thought more constantly of others than he; and part of her bashfulness arose from a wish to take from those around her a sense of inferiority; a feeling which never crossed her mind.
"""I am not mad,"" I cried energetically; ""the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth."
"CHAPTER IV Among our most assiduous visitors was a young man of rank, well informed, and agreable in his person."
"Their yells were drowned in the clamour of elements, and the thunder rivings of their unwieldy habitation they discovered at last that the water gained on them, and they betook themselves to their pumps; they might as well have laboured to empty the ocean by bucketfuls."
"Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again."
"She was too unlike them, too utterly alien to their tastes, for them to find delight in her society, or in the prospect of its continuance, but it gave them pleasure to see her conciliating and kind."
"To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self interest, are full of brotherly love and charity."
"Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair."
A man of this kind was now pouring forth his eloquent despair among the inhabitants of Windsor.
"But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was forever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance."
I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.
"He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors."""
"What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans."
"Her dark hair was braided and twined in thick knots like the head dress of a Grecian statue; her garb was mean, but her attitude might have been selected as a model of grace."
As soon as I perceived him I suddenly rose to escape from his observation by entering among the trees.
"He listened with haughtiness, replied disdainfully; and, if in truth, she succeeded in awakening his conscience, the sole effect was that he sought an opiate for the pang in oblivious riot."
"They gathered round him, counted their numbers, and detailed the reasons why they were now to receive an addition of such and such members, who had not yet declared themselves."
I saw a change in her also.
"We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish."
"My daughter, I love you"" The last words died away in a hoarse whisper, but I heard them and sunk on the ground, covering my face and almost dead with excess of sickness and fear: a cold perspiration covered my forehead and I shivered in every limb But he continued, clasping his hands with a frantic gesture: ""Now I have dashed from the top of the rock to the bottom Now I have precipitated myself down the fearful chasm The danger is over; she is alive Oh, Mathilda, lift up those dear eyes in the light of which I live."
"Return speedily, Lionel."""
"The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins."
"I became intimate with him, and each day afforded me occasion to admire more and more his powerful and versatile talents, that together with his eloquence, which was graceful and witty, and his wealth now immense, caused him to be feared, loved, and hated beyond any other man in England."
"Poor William he was our darling and our pride"" Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame."
"The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated."
Her face was radiant with a smile.
"As I grew older books in some degree supplied the place of human intercourse: the library of my aunt was very small; Shakespear, Milton, Pope and Cowper were the strangley sic assorted poets of her collection; and among the prose authors a translation of Livy and Rollin's ancient history were my chief favourites although as I emerged from childhood I found others highly interesting which I had before neglected as dull."
Yet while he earnestly occupied himself about the wants of others his own desires were gratified to their fullest extent.
Yet I do not pretend to account for my mood by any particular event.
When the servant came back she gave me a letter.
"I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame."
I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy.
"I heard of the death of only sons; of wives and husbands most devoted; of the rending of ties twisted with the heart's fibres, of friend losing friend, and young mothers mourning for their first born; and these moving incidents were grouped and painted in my mind by the knowledge of the persons, by my esteem and affection for the sufferers."
"He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover."
"There are many books which can feed the appetite craving for these things; let them turn to the accounts of Boccaccio, De Foe, and Browne."
Not a word had been spoken during the present session on any of these topics.
"The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history."
"CHAPTER VII With a beating heart and fearful, I knew not why, I dismissed the servant and locking my door, sat down to read my father's letter."
Perdita's name was for ever joined with his; their conjugal felicity was celebrated even by the authentic testimony of facts.
It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.
"He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself."
"We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion."
"The cup of life was poisoned forever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me."
"I particularly mark this night, for it was that which has hurried on the last scene of my tragedy, which else might have dwindled on through long years of listless sorrow."
"He was an inferior actor, but truth now made him excellent; as he went on to announce to Macduff the slaughter of his family, he was afraid to speak, trembling from apprehension of a burst of grief from the audience, not from his fellow mime."
"Alas I now met frowns where before I had been welcomed only with smiles: he, my beloved father, shunned me, and either treated me with harshness or a more heart breaking coldness."
"But my nerveless hands can neither fell the trees, nor smooth the planks."
"Insatiate thirst for knowledge, and boundless affection for Adrian, combined to keep both my heart and understanding occupied, and I was consequently happy."
"I came to an open space a mountain of ruin in the midst, announced that some large mosque had occupied the space and here, scattered about, I saw various articles of luxury and wealth, singed, destroyed but shewing what they had been in their ruin jewels, strings of pearls, embroidered robes, rich furs, glittering tapestries, and oriental ornaments, seemed to have been collected here in a pile destined for destruction; but the rain had stopped the havoc midway."
"He soon conquered my latent distaste; I endeavoured to watch him and Perdita, and to keep in mind every thing I had heard to his disadvantage."
"Come then, no more delay, thou tardy one Behold the pleasant potion Look, I am a spirit of good, and not a human maid that invites thee, and with winning accents, oh, that they would win thee says, Come and drink."""
"The same peculiarities of character rendered her sorrows agonies; her fancy magnified them, her sensibility made her for ever open to their renewed impression; love envenomed the heart piercing sting."
I am well acquainted with the accused.
"She started up, she threw herself on his neck, she gasped and sobbed; he took her hand, and leading her to the sofa, sat down near her."
"After the lovers again joined me, we supped together in the alcove."
"Raymond continued, ""I will not act a part with you, dear girl, or appear other than what I am, weak and unworthy, more fit to excite your disdain than your love."
"He paused, and was lost in thought."
"I dismissed the guests therefore; and they went thoughtful, more than sad, to await the events in store for them."
"But I was languid and many hours passed before I could reach the cottage, dragging as I did my slow steps, and often resting on the wet earth unable to proceed."
"Now that I am arrived at its base, my pinions are furled, the mighty stairs are before me, and step by step I must ascend the wondrous fane Speak What door is opened?"
We arrived at Kishan on the th of July.
"The cavern shape the stage assumed, the beetling rocks, the glare of the fire, the misty shades that crossed the scene at times, the music in harmony with all witch like fancies, permitted the imagination to revel, without fear of contradiction, or reproof from reason or the heart."
"He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake."
"My soul is a fading spark, my nature frail as a spent wave; but I dedicate all of intellect and strength that remains to me, to that one work, and take upon me the task, as far as I am able, of bestowing blessings on my fellow men"" His voice trembled, his eyes were cast up, his hands clasped, and his fragile person was bent, as it were, with excess of emotion."
"And yet I fear it; even as I fear all things; for in any state of being linked by the chain of memory with this, happiness would not return even in Paradise, I must feel that your love was less enduring than the mortal beatings of my fragile heart, every pulse of which knells audibly, The funeral note Of love, deep buried, without resurrection."
All was strange and admirable to the shepherd of Cumberland.
"Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly."
"At the commencement of summer, we began to feel, that the mischief which had taken place in distant countries was greater than we had at first suspected."
"""You will never hear from me again: receive these then as the last words of mine that will ever reach you; and although I have forfeited your filial love, yet regard them I conjure you as a father's command."
"On our side the soldiers grasped their arms firmly, and looked with stern glances on the foe."
"A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property."
"It evidently declined, without any symptom which could lead us to suspect his disease, unless indeed his brightened eyes, animated look, and flustering cheeks, made us dread consumption; but he was without pain or fear."
"The English, whether travellers or residents, came pouring in one great revulsive stream, back on their own country; and with them crowds of Italians and Spaniards."
How shall I ever repay you?
"I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation."
"Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world."
A call for the boat to be lowered was echoed from the deck.
"I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college."
"The music died away, the shouts abruptly ended; the soldiers had cleared a space in which a carriage was drawn up."
"Falsehood and artifice are in themselves so hateful, that, though I still thought I did right, a feeling of shame and guilt came painfully upon me."
"Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave worms crawling in the folds of the flannel."
They inspired the soldiers with the same sentiment.
Could I behold this and live?
"I was sitting by my fire, the physician who had attended me ever since my fever had just left me, and I looked over his prescription in which digitalis was the prominent medecine."
"It was to be hoped that their efforts would succeed, and that though now a prisoner, the sport of cruelty and the mark of hate, he would be rescued from danger and restored to the happiness, power, and honour which he deserved."
"""We do also, unfortunately,"" replied my father, ""for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly."""
"This, proud noble, is your last night Perdita has bestowed on it all of magnificent and dazzling that your heart best loves but, from these gorgeous rooms, from this princely attendance, from power and elevation, you must return with to morrow's sun to our rural abode; for I would not buy an immortality of joy, by the endurance of one more week sister to the last."
"My friend shortened the harangue, by taking the man's torch from him; and we proceeded alone."
"On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived."
We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream.
This abode of penury may at least prove the disinterestedness of my conduct.
It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
"""This is infinitely ridiculous,"" he cried, ""if you were school boys, you could not conduct yourselves more unreasonably."""
"Both then withdrew; though, as she went, the Countess said, ""Softly; all sleep; though all have not been prepared for sleep, like her."
"To live, according to this sense of the word, we must not only observe and learn, we must also feel; we must not be mere spectators of action, we must act; we must not describe, but be subjects of description."
Once it was so; now is man lord of the creation?
"I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart."
"For alone, when no voice can disturb my dream, and no cold eye meet mine to check its fire, then I may commune with his spirit; on a lone heath, at noon or at midnight, still I should be near him."
Two or three petitioners were still in attendance.
"In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder."
Fortunately I had money with me.
"During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings."
"We had lived so long in the vicinity of Eton, that its population of young folks was well known to us."
"Alas I even now look back with disgust at my artifices and contrivances by which, after many painful struggles, I effected my retreat."
"Stung with impatience, I urged my horse with force of spur and loosened reins down the acclivity, that, before danger could arrive, I might be at the side of my noble, godlike friend."
"However it might be, neither plague nor war could prevent Perdita from following her lord, or induce her to utter one objection to the plans which he proposed."
"""Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice."""
"It was the height of his offending, that he should occasion in me such intolerable sensations, and not deign himself to afford any demonstration that he was aware that I even lived to feel them."
There does not exist the man in England with adequate presumption.
"I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment."
"I was aware also that I should often lose all self command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation."
Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.
"Idris, who entertained the highest opinion of his abilities, was warmly interested in the event: and my poor sister, who dared not hope, and to whom fear was misery, was plunged into a fever of disquietude."
She seemed to consider that through me she had lost Raymond; I was the evil influence of her life; I was even accused of encreasing and confirming the mad and base apostacy of Adrian from all views of advancement and grandeur; and now this miserable mountaineer was to steal her daughter.
"But his fate was still uncertain; she began to fear the worst, and to feel that her soul's hope was cast on a chance that might prove a blank."
"Cheer up, or I shall make you over to Idris, and call Adrian into the carriage, who, I see by his gesture, sympathizes with my good spirits."""
"""As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early."
"I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared."
"Now life is all that we covet; that this automaton of flesh should, with joints and springs in order, perform its functions, that this dwelling of the soul should be capable of containing its dweller."
"You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not."
The weather during our journey had been serene.
"Adrian, Idris and I, were established in Windsor Castle; Lord Raymond and my sister, inhabited a house which the former had built on the borders of the Great Park, near Perdita's cottage, as was still named the low roofed abode, where we two, poor even in hope, had each received the assurance of our felicity."
I own that I did not see her misfortune with the same eyes as Perdita.
"But, even though threatened by famine, her fear of the plague was paramount; and her greatest care was to avoid her fellow creatures."
I took no merit to myself for this.
"""This is going too far,"" her mother answered, with quivering lips, and eyes again instinct by anger."
"Clinging, with the dastard feeling of the aged, to the remnant of her spent life, she had, on hearing that the pestilence had come into her neighbourhood, barred her door, and closed her casement, refusing to communicate with any."
"He sat beside her; and, taking the paper from her hand, said, ""Not a word more shall my sweet Perdita read of this contention of madmen and fools."
"When love is no longer akin to hate, then brotherhood will exist: we are very far from that state at present."" ""Not so far as you may suppose,"" observed a little old astronomer, by name Merrival, ""the poles precede slowly, but securely; in an hundred thousand years "" ""We shall all be underground,"" said Ryland."
"Her views with regard to her own children, placed all her words and actions relative to them under restraint: but Evadne was a plaything she could in no way fear; nor were her talents and vivacity slight alleviations to the monotony of the Countess's life."
"In the mean time, Raymond had remained with Adrian and Idris."
"We were directed to the ward where her husband had been first taken, and still was, the nurse said, if alive."
"How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair."
"I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind."
"He will feel highly honoured, and thus you may repay a part of the obligation I owe him, and compensate for the injuries fortune has done him."""
"I will say no more; for I can add nothing to what I have already said, to what you before contemptuously set aside."
"Little Evelyn had endeavoured to draw Clara away to play with him; but the Italian's tale arrested her, she crept near, her lustrous eyes fixed on the speaker."
"She received my concurrence with pleasure, and a thousand times over thanked her deceiving, deceitful brother."
"The concentrated pride of her nature, forgotten during her blissful dream, awoke, and with its adder's sting pierced her heart; her humility of spirit augmented the power of the venom; she had been exalted in her own estimation, while distinguished by his love: of what worth was she, now that he thrust her from this preferment?"
"He snatched his hand from me, and rose in violent disorder: ""What do you mean?"
"""Come, I see that you have already cast aside the sad thoughts you before franticly indulged."
"""Your affectionate and afflicted father, ""Alphonse Frankenstein."
We had our separate occupations and our common amusements.
"Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household."
"We, a commercial people, were obliged to bring such schemes under consideration; and the question of contagion became matter of earnest disquisition."
"Now that unchanged serenity, and gentle compliance were added to her other qualifications, his respect equalled his love."
"""Yes,"" I said, ""I see how this is, and it is strange that I should have deceived myself so long; I am about to die an innocent death, and it will be sweeter even than that which the opium promised."""
"Under the influence of these melancholy thoughts, she became more than ever in love with sorrow."
"But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life."
"Once, when thirteen years of age, I was sent for a month to the county jail."
"I find myself, for one, as a stringed instrument with chords and stops but I have no power to turn the pegs, or pitch my thoughts to a higher or lower key."""
I met him at the distance of thirty miles from our mansion.
"Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul."
"In the mean time, we, the wise of the land, will return to our Castle, and, Cincinnatus like, take to our usual labours, until our friend shall require our presence and assistance here."""
Such sentiments actuated our little circle.
"Bless thy child even even sic in death, as I bless thee; and let me sleep at peace in my quiet grave."""
"""Let me entreat Adrian,"" I cried, ""not to comply: rather join with me in endeavouring to withdraw Lord Raymond from this scene, and restore him to other society."""
CHAPTER IX Thus I passed two years.
I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely.
"Plague is the companion of spring, of sunshine, and plenty."
"I sat on the sole remaining step of an edifice, which even in its downfall, was huge and magnificent; a few broken walls, not dislodged by gunpowder, stood in fantastic groupes, and a flame glimmered at intervals on the summit of the pile."
"""Talk not of other season than this"" he cried."
"But when any whole nation becomes the victim of the destructive powers of exterior agents, then indeed man shrinks into insignificance, he feels his tenure of life insecure, his inheritance on earth cut off."
"From such scenes I have sometimes saved a deserted infant sometimes led a young and grieving mother from the lifeless image of her first born, or drawn the sturdy labourer from childish weeping over his extinct family."
"Believe me, he was destined to be the author of infinite good to his native England."
"I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly."
It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.
"I feared madness, not sickness I have a presentiment that Adrian will not die; perhaps this illness is a crisis, and he may recover."""
Her expressive eyes were two stars whose beams were love; hope and light heartedness sat on her cloudless brow.
"When he found me a vagabond shepherd of the hills, a poacher, an unlettered savage, still his kindness did not fail."
"The Turkish army were at this time besieging Rodosto; and the Greeks, hastening their preparations, and sending each day reinforcements, were on the eve of forcing the enemy to battle."
"She gazed on some flowers that stood near in a carved vase: that morning she had arranged them, they were rare and lovely plants; even now all aghast as she was, she observed their brilliant colours and starry shapes."
But let us change the subject.
But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.
"Raymond's beloved Athenians, the free, the noble people of the divinest town in Greece, fell like ripe corn before the merciless sickle of the adversary."
"That same invincible monster, which hovered over and devoured Constantinople that fiend more cruel than tempest, less tame than fire, is, alas, unchained in that beautiful country these reflections would not allow me to rest."
"She began to count the long days, and months, and years which must elapse, before he would be restored to a private station, and unreservedly to her."
I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information.
"She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep."
"He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable."
"As at the conclusion of the eighteenth century, the English unlocked their hospitable store, for the relief of those driven from their homes by political revolution; so now they were not backward in affording aid to the victims of a more wide spreading calamity."
"On the same evening, he went alone to the house named to him."
"I felt as if I were recreated and had about me all the freshness and life of a new being: I was, as it were, transported since his arrival from a narrow spot of earth into a universe boundless to the imagination and the understanding."
In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.
"He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science."
"Something more was in his heart, to which he dared not give words."
You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.
"""Once I desired to be a king."
"I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been."
CHAPTER X It was six months after this miserable conclusion to his long nursed hopes that I first saw him.
"The battle was sanguinary, the loss of the Turks apparently irreparable; the Greeks, in losing one man, forgot the nameless crowd strewed upon the bloody field, and they ceased to value themselves on a victory, which cost them Raymond."
"He transacted public business with distaste, and hastened from it to the solitude which was at once his bane and relief."
"who loved him, as he did her; notwithstanding that disappointment quelled her passion, and ambition held strong combat with his."
"The excitement which had hitherto sustained me was lost; as a building, whose props are loosened, and whose foundations rock, totters and falls, so when enthusiasm and hope deserted me, did my strength fail."
"Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate."
I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.
"My life was spent among tangible realities, hers was a dream."
"Two o'clock struck, after which none were admitted; those who had been disappointed went sullenly or sorrowfully away, while I entered the audience chamber."
"He loved me with a guilty passion, and stung by remorse and despair he killed himself."
"""You may easily believe,"" said he, ""how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: 'I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.'"
Could any thing but unmixed joy flow from such a union?
"I am not like one of these; they influenced millions: but if I can influence but a hundred, but ten, but one solitary individual, so as in any way to lead him from ill to good, that will be a joy to repay me for all my sufferings, though they were a million times multiplied; and that hope will support me to bear them."
"Alexander was a king; Solomon, the wisest of men, was a king; Napoleon was a king; Caesar died in his attempt to become one, and Cromwell, the puritan and king killer, aspired to regality."
"I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe."
"What wonder then, in time of siege, want, extreme heat, and drought, that it should make unaccustomed ravages?"
"A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse."
"With faltering accents Clara promised, while she still clung to her father in a transport of sorrow."
"But, come, this splenetic fit is already passed; resume your functions; your partizans will hail you; your enemies be silenced; our love, honour, and duty will again be manifested towards you."
"I could never, while with him, think of his bounty as a remedy to my poverty; and I even put aside hastily his offers of supplies, assuring him of a falsehood, that I needed them not."
"Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness."
"When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como."
He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky.
And thus it was that although the spirit of friendship soothed me for a while it could not restore me.
"I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free."
"I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings."
"This hour, melancholy yet sweet, has always seemed to me the time when we are most naturally led to commune with higher powers; our mortal sternness departs, and gentle complacency invests the soul."
"My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon."
This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.
"Well, this could not last."
"She had to do this, while in deep woe she sighed for loneliness, and would gladly have exchanged her crowded rooms for dark forest depths, or a drear, night enshadowed heath."
"""Felix trembled violently as he said this."
I remembered that Idris had been kept in ignorance of my proceedings.
Yet we were not all to die.
"The vast cities of America, the fertile plains of Hindostan, the crowded abodes of the Chinese, are menaced with utter ruin."
"But Clara was jealous of their services; she would be sole handmaid of Idris, sole minister to the wants of her little cousins; nothing gave her so much pleasure as our employing her in this way; she went beyond our desires, earnest, diligent, and unwearied, Abra was ready ere we called her name, And though we called another, Abra came."
"He had begun his speech with vehemence; he ended with unassuming gentleness, making his appeal with the same humility, as if he had asked to be the first in wealth, honour, and power among Englishmen, and not, as was the truth, to be the foremost in the ranks of loathsome toils and inevitable death."
"He declared, notwithstanding her harshness, he even called it coldness, that he loved her."
"Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you."
"I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp."
"Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon."
Some were destroyed; the major part escaped by quick and well ordered movements; and danger made them careful.
"The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight."
"He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake."
Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.
"He began at last to shew signs of angry impatience, and Perdita became aware that the system she had adopted could not continue; she must explain herself to him; she could not summon courage to speak she wrote thus: ""Read this letter with patience, I entreat you."
"Death is the goal that I would attain, but, alas I do not even see the end of the course."
"The inhabitants of Berkshire and Bucks had been long aware that the plague was in London, in Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, York, in short, in all the more populous towns of England."
Do not for ever look sorrow and never speak it; utter one word of bitter complaint and I will reprove it with gentle exhortation and pour on you the balm of compassion.
"If she had been nurtured by those who had regarded her with affection, she might have been different; but unloved and neglected, she repaid want of kindness with distrust and silence."
"In person, he hardly appeared of this world; his slight frame was overinformed by the soul that dwelt within; he was all mind; ""Man but a rush against"" his breast, and it would have conquered his strength; but the might of his smile would have tamed an hungry lion, or caused a legion of armed men to lay their weapons at his feet."
This was the key of my design.
Has she not bestowed on him every gift in prodigality?
I am a part of this scene; each and all its properties are a part of me.
The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.
"Our empty habitations remained, but the dwellers were gathered to the shades of the tomb."
"But other ingredients mingled with these, and prevented him from becoming the calculating, determined character, which alone forms a successful hero."
They looked at one another and were unable to reply.
"There was a simple, natural earnestness about her that interested me in her fate, especially when she assured me that her husband was the best of men, had been so, till want of business during these unhappy times had thrown him into bad company."
"It was small relief to him that our discipline should gain us success in such a conflict; while plague still hovered to equalize the conqueror and the conquered, it was not victory that he desired, but bloodless peace."
"Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy."
"Perdita shook her head; ""If it could be so,"" she replied, ""I were much in the wrong to disdain your offers."
"It is our distance from them and our imperfect means of communication that makes them appear to move; in truth they always remain stationary, a glorious centre, giving us a fine lesson of modesty if we would thus receive it."""

I shall not be suspected of being averse to the Greek cause; I know and feel its necessity; it is beyond every other a good cause.
Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.
For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
I looked on these; I turned my gaze to my own mean dress.
"Nor did her angry dislike prevent Adrian from imaging my father, as he had said, the type of all that was gallant, amiable, and fascinating in man."

"He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me."
"We are born; we choose neither our parents, nor our station; we are educated by others, or by the world's circumstance, and this cultivation, mingling with our innate disposition, is the soil in which our desires, passions, and motives grow."""
"I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva."
But a home of love awaits you in your native England.
"I am glad that I have seen the changes of his day; to behold the sun, fountain of light, and the gentle pilgrim moon; to have seen the fire bearing flowers of the sky, and the flowery stars of earth; to have witnessed the sowing and the harvest."

Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted."
"Raymond, being somewhat recovered, prepared to re assume his command in the army."

"His information was at first received with silence; a confused murmur succeeded; and, when the chairman declared Lord Raymond duly chosen, it amounted to a shout of applause and victory."
My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.
"Bankers, merchants, and manufacturers, whose trade depended on exports and interchange of wealth, became bankrupt."
"My mother, pennyless and burthened with two children, waited week after week, and month after month, in sickening expectation of a reply, which never came."
We sunk into silence: a silence that drank in the doleful accounts and prognostications of our guest.
"The least illness caused throes of terror; she was miserable if she were at all absent from them; her treasure of happiness she had garnered in their fragile being, and kept forever on the watch, lest the insidious thief should as before steal these valued gems."
"I awoke half stupefied; I felt a heavy oppression on me, but knew not wherefore; I entered, as it were, the council chamber of my brain, and questioned the various ministers of thought therein assembled; too soon I remembered all; too soon my limbs quivered beneath the tormenting power; soon, too soon, I knew myself a slave Suddenly, unannounced, Lord Raymond entered my apartment."
"Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar."

"Wordsworth has compared a beloved female to two fair objects in nature; but his lines always appeared to me rather a contrast than a similitude: A violet by a mossy stone Half hidden from the eye, Fair as a star when only one Is shining in the sky."
Raymond gave her his ring to ensure the respect of the menials.
He drew a glowing picture of its present situation.
I stood ready to receive and reply to his reproaches.
"We were all equal now; but near at hand was an equality still more levelling, a state where beauty and strength, and wisdom, would be as vain as riches and birth."
"The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet."

"As Windsor lay, to a great degree, in the line of march from the west, I removed my family to London, assigning the Tower for their sojourn, and joining Adrian, acted as his Lieutenant in the coming struggle."
Ryland groaned; cold drops stood on his brow.
I must be more brief for night draws on apace and all my hours in this house are counted.
"For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking."
"The tenor of my actions will prove that I had rather die, than be a mark for scorn behold the proud Evadne in her tatters look on the beggar princess There is aspic venom in the thought promise me that my secret shall not be violated by you."""
"After the revolution of ages Birnam hill was again covered with a young forest, while more aged pines, planted at the very commencement of the nineteenth century by the then Duke of Athol, gave solemnity and beauty to the scene."

I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed.
I was now conscious of a change.
"I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around."
"To change the scene for her, and even for ourselves, all unhinged by the cloud that had come over us, I persuaded my two remaining companions that it were better that we should absent ourselves for a time from Windsor."
But in the city things wore a different face.
"I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose."

"I ran on at my utmost speed until I found myself I knew not how, close to Westminster Abbey, and was attracted by the deep and swelling tone of the organ."

But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.
"But Woodville's words had magic in them, when beginning with the sweetest pity, he would raise me by degrees out of myself and my sorrows until I wondered at my own selfishness: but he left me and despair returned; the work of consolation was ever to begin anew."
"But I forget myself, my tale is yet untold."
"Oh What a night it was And I passed on with quick steps among the high, dank grass amid the rain and tempest."
"No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing."
"But life was yet strong within me; I recovered: nor did it a little aid my returning health that my recollections were at first vague, and that I was too weak to feel any violent emotion."
She knew that Raymond had conversed with her; had he instigated this request?
"Come, I see that you are already persuaded, and will second me when I propose him to night in parliament."""
"She listened eagerly to him, yet tantalized herself by giving to his words a meaning foreign to their true interpretation, and adverse to her hopes."
It was a life of toil; for rain and cold were more frequent than sunshine; but it was my pride to contemn the elements.
"She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair."
"But although St. Stephen's did not echo with the voice which filled each heart, the newspapers teemed with nothing else; and in private companies the conversation however remotely begun, soon verged towards this central point, while voices were lowered and chairs drawn closer."

"We entered London in the evening, and went to our several abodes near Hyde Park."
"The care of me while a baby, and afterwards untill I had reached my eighth year devolved on a servant of my mother's, who had accompanied us in our retirement for that purpose."
"""But do not you see, Lionel, the drift of our noble friend; a drift, perhaps, unknown to himself, but apparent to me."
"""It is a strange link in my fate that without having seen you I should passionately love you."
"I returned to Windsor by the Long Walk, and passing through the town towards the Castle, I found it in a state of agitation and disturbance."
We went together to the House in the evening.
"My country, my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me."
"Her countenance was all expression; her eyes were not dark, but impenetrably deep; you seemed to discover space after space in their intellectual glance, and to feel that the soul which was their soul, comprehended an universe of thought in its ken."
"Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph."

"She tried to rouse herself, but her eyes every now and then filled with tears, and she looked wistfully on Raymond and her girl, as if fearful that some evil would betide them."
"But such miseries could never intrude upon the domestic circle left to me, while, secluded in our beloved forest, we passed our lives in tranquillity."
"Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?"""
"Walking, riding, the common occupations of life, overcame him: he felt no pain, but seemed to tremble for ever on the verge of annihilation."
"She spoke quickly, as if to convince herself; she turned her eyes from the trees and forest paths she loved; she hid her face in my bosom, and we yes, my masculine firmness dissolved we wept together consolatory tears, and then calm nay, almost cheerful, we returned to the castle."
"Seven years ago, in her youthful prime, she had become attached to him; he had served her country against the Turks; he had in her own land acquired that military glory peculiarly dear to the Greeks, since they were still obliged inch by inch to fight for their security."
"There was evidently something behind all this; yet, when he appeared about to speak of that which was nearest his heart, he would abruptly turn away, and with a sigh endeavour to deliver the painful idea to the winds."
"I appear to have strength, power, victory; standing as a dome supporting column stands; and I am a reed I have ambition, and that attains its aim; my nightly dreams are realized, my waking hopes fulfilled; a kingdom awaits my acceptance, my enemies are overthrown."
"I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds."
Perdita reproached us bitterly.
"Do not endeavour to deprive me of my companion, the out cast's friend."
"At about midnight Raymond and I took leave of my sister, to return to town."
Great pains had been taken in the scenery to give the semblance of reality to the impossible.
"As he spoke, I felt subject to him; and all my boasted pride and strength were subdued by the honeyed accents of this blue eyed boy."
"""Next summer,"" said Adrian as we parted on our return to Windsor, ""will decide the fate of the human race."
And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society.
Such was the maniac language of her enthusiasm.
"I have said, that the defects of her character awoke and acquired vigour from her unnatural position."
Perdita was sensible of the failing of the tide that fed her life.
Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.
"Joy and exultation, were mine, to possess, and to save her."
"I can do this I can marry Idris."""
we asked: can we enter here?
On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.
"""We know not what all this wide world means; its strange mixture of good and evil."
And then of what use would be pursuit?
"Raymond was inspirited by the intense sensations of recovered health; he felt that in being general of the Athenians, he filled a post worthy of his ambition; and, in his hope of the conquest of Constantinople, he counted on an event which would be as a landmark in the waste of ages, an exploit unequalled in the annals of man; when a city of grand historic association, the beauty of whose site was the wonder of the world, which for many hundred years had been the strong hold of the Moslems, should be rescued from slavery and barbarism, and restored to a people illustrious for genius, civilization, and a spirit of liberty."
"We lengthened our tour into Scotland, that we might see Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond; thence we crossed to Ireland, and passed several weeks in the neighbourhood of Killarney."

"Then, agitated as she had been by her mother's violence, and now by unaccustomed fears, she lay unable to sleep, starting at every sound."
"The green woods waved their boughs majestically, while the dying were spread beneath their shade, answering the solemn melody with inharmonious cries."
She shed indeed many tears; her head sunk unconsciously on the shoulder of Raymond; he held her hand: he kissed her sunken tear stained cheek.
Yet how was I to do this?
"On landing at Athens we found difficulties encrease upon us: nor could the storied earth or balmy atmosphere inspire us with enthusiasm or pleasure, while the fate of Raymond was in jeopardy."
"He had sought this office with eagerness, under the idea of turning his whole forces to the suppression of the privileged orders of our community."

"But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier."
"He shewed how England had become powerful, and its inhabitants valiant and wise, by means of the freedom they enjoyed."
"She endeavoured to bring him up in a sense of resentment towards, and a desire to revenge himself upon, those who had been instrumental in bringing about his father's abdication."
"He would come triumphantly to the district to which my parent had fled broken hearted; he would find the ill fated offspring, bequeathed with such vain confidence to his royal father, miserable paupers."
"As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate."
"For awhile my labours were not solitary; but that time is gone; and, with the selected and matchless companion of my toils, their dearest reward is also lost to me Di mie tenere frondi altro lavoro Credea mostrarte; e qual fero pianeta Ne' nvidio insieme, o mio nobil tesoro?"
"His soul was sympathy, and dedicated to the worship of beauty and excellence."
"I owe this to Greece, to you, to my surviving Perdita, and to myself, the victim of ambition."""
I took it up and placed it in my breast.
"There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble."
"There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her."
It came as some gentle visitation; it went and I hardly felt the loss.
You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.
"Why do you bring me out, and torture me, and tempt me, and kill me Much happier would it be for you and for me if in your frantic curiosity you tore my heart from my breast and tried to read its secrets in it as its life's blood was dropping from it."
"""I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving."""
"""Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva."
"A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path."
"The females received them on their return with the simple and affectionate welcome known before only to the lowly cottage a clean hearth and bright fire; the supper ready cooked by beloved hands; gratitude for the provision for to morrow's meal: strange enjoyments for the high born English, yet they were now their sole, hard earned, and dearly prized luxuries."
"In vain did the eye strive to find the wreck of some northern cloud in the stainless empyrean, which might bring hope of change and moisture to the oppressive and windless atmosphere."
"Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride."
My death is rapidly approaching and you are not near to watch the flitting and vanishing of my spirit.
"He Woodville, mourned the loss of his bride: others wept the various forms of misery as they visited them: but infamy and guilt was mingled with my portion; unlawful and detestable passion had poured its poison into my ears and changed all my blood, so that it was no longer the kindly stream that supports life but a cold fountain of bitterness corrupted in its very source."
"He would embark in a balloon; he would sail for a distant quarter of the world, where his name and humiliation were unknown."
"By degrees his health was shaken by his misery, and then his intellect yielded to the same tyranny."
"This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself."
"I found if sorrow was dead within me, so was love and desire of sympathy."
"Listen to me, and then reflect if you ought to win me to your project, even if with the over bearing eloquence of despair you could make black death so inviting that the fair heaven should appear darkness."
"At the moment, I felt convinced that I was acting for the best, and that all I did was right and even necessary."
You doubtless recollect these papers.
Some gazed on these processions with wild eagerness others fled timidly some wept aloud.
"All factitious colouring disappeared death rose like night, and, protected by its murky shadows the blush of modesty, the reserve of pride, the decorum of prudery were frequently thrown aside as useless veils."
"Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins."
"While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: ""Welcome, my dearest Victor,"" said he. ""Ah I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted."
Alfred's serious air shewed that he still revolved the tragic story related by the Italian boy.
"Such had been Ryland's plan, and he was discovered dead and half devoured by insects, in a house many miles from any other, with piles of food laid up in useless superfluity."
She prayed for her husband's soul; she conjured the Supreme to place on her head the crime of his self destruction she vowed to live to expiate his fault.
It must be the excess of madness that could make me imagine that I could ever be aught but one alone; struck off from humanity; bearing no affinity to man or woman; a wretch on whom Nature had set her ban.
"Do you think that I will be questioned, and my replies disdainfully set aside? Do you think that I will be suspected, perhaps watched, cross questioned, and disbelieved?"
"Each felt, that England had never seen a Protector so capable of fulfilling the arduous duties of that high office."

"Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture."
"I did not tell her, that to spare her the pang of parting from inanimate objects, now the only things left, I had resolved that we should none of us return to Windsor."

"The ruins of majestic oaks which had grown, flourished, and decayed during the progress of centuries, marked where the limits of the forest once reached, while the shattered palings and neglected underwood shewed that this part was deserted for the younger plantations, which owed their birth to the beginning of the nineteenth century, and now stood in the pride of maturity."
"It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged."
"Having cast her fate upon a die, and feeling secure of winning, she, whom I have named as bearing the stamp of queen of nations on her noble brow, now rose superior to humanity, and seemed in calm power, to arrest with her finger, the wheel of destiny."
"Her person was formed in the most feminine proportions; she was not tall, but her mountain life had given freedom to her motions, so that her light step scarce made her foot fall heard as she tript across the hall to meet me."
This was the only cloud in the azure of her happiness.
"""You turn from me; yet before you deny me reflect, Woodville, how sweet it were to cast off the load of tears and misery under which we now labour: and surely we shall find light after we have passed the dark valley."

"After this Martha was seated more firmly than ever on the regal seat, elevated by reverence and love."
"The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father's house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved."

"The very spirit of the Greek mythology inhabited my heart; I deified the uplands, glades, and streams, I Had sight of Proteus coming from the sea; And heard old Triton blow his wreathed horn."
"""As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection."
"Genius, devotion, and courage; the adornments of his mind, and the energies of his soul, all exerted to their uttermost stretch, could not roll back one hair's breadth the wheel of time's chariot; that which had been was written with the adamantine pen of reality, on the everlasting volume of the past; nor could agony and tears suffice to wash out one iota from the act fulfilled."
"It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society."""

"Soon we heard their disorderly clamour, the barbarian shouts, the untimed step of thousands coming on in disarray."
"With sunken cheek and hollow eyes, pale and gaunt, how could I recognize the beloved of Perdita?"

I must do justice to my sweet sister: it was not for herself that she was thus agonized.
"Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference."

"He was incapable of meeting these evils by any comprehensive system; he had resorted to expedient after expedient, and could never be induced to put a remedy in force, till it came too late to be of use."

"Idris sat at the bedside, holding Evelyn's hand; we were afraid to speak to each other; I watched the stars I hung over my child I felt his little pulse I drew near the mother again I receded."
"Then mighty art thou, O wind, to be throned above all other vicegerents of nature's power; whether thou comest destroying from the east, or pregnant with elementary life from the west; thee the clouds obey; the sun is subservient to thee; the shoreless ocean is thy slave Thou sweepest over the earth, and oaks, the growth of centuries, submit to thy viewless axe; the snow drift is scattered on the pinnacles of the Alps, the avalanche thunders down their vallies."
"But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings."
"I and my enemy were still struggling, when the wounded man exclaimed, ""The Earl"" I sprang out of the herculean hold of the keeper, panting from my exertions; I cast furious glances on my persecutors, and placing myself with my back to a tree, resolved to defend myself to the last."
"They were in the end all sunk, and, with the exception of two or three prisoners, the crews drowned."
"Adrian replied, ""Whither indeed would you fly?"
But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.
"I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone."
I RETURNED to my family estate in the autumn of the year .
At first his mother treated his theories as the wild ravings of inexperience.
"Perhaps, after the labours and stupendous excitement of the past summer, the calm of winter and the almost menial toils it brought with it, were by natural re action doubly irksome."
My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
"This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room."
"But other generations will arise, and ever and for ever will continue, to be made happier by our present acts, to be glorified by our valour."
"Soon some people, deputed by the magistrates, came to remove the body; the unfortunate being saw a jailor in each he fled precipitately, while I passed onwards to the Castle."
"Sheath your weapons; these are your brothers, commit not fratricide; soon the plague will not leave one for you to glut your revenge upon: will you be more pitiless than pestilence?"
"This reflection thawed my congealing blood, and again the tide of life and love flowed impetuously onward, again to ebb as my busy thoughts changed."
"My companion looked eagerly from one bed to the other, till at the end of the ward she espied, on a wretched bed, a squalid, haggard creature, writhing under the torture of disease."
"""This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked."
"I revolved again and again all that I remembered my mother to have told me of my father's former life; I contemplated the few relics I possessed belonging to him, which spoke of greater refinement than could be found among the mountain cottages; but nothing in all this served as a guide to lead me to another and pleasanter way of life."
"I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus."
"She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream."
"The perfect confidence that subsisted between Perdita and him, rendered every communication common between them."
"To tell all my grief I might as well attempt to count the tears that have fallen from these eyes, or every sign that has torn my heart."
"Does not a stream, boundless as ocean, deep as vacuum, yawn between us?"" Raymond rose, his voice was broken, his features convulsed, his manner calm as the earthquake cradling atmosphere, he replied: ""I am rejoiced that you take my decision so philosophically."
"Yesterday those limbs were worth an universe; they then enshrined a transcendant power, whose intents, words, and actions were worthy to be recorded in letters of gold; now the superstition of affection alone could give value to the shattered mechanism, which, incapable and clod like, no more resembled Raymond, than the fallen rain is like the former mansion of cloud in which it climbed the highest skies, and gilded by the sun, attracted all eyes, and satiated the sense by its excess of beauty."
Perhaps also my passion was lulled to content by the deep and exclusive affection you felt for me.
"Some trifling business of the House having been gone through, the leaders took their seats in the chamber; the clamour of voices continued, till Ryland arose to speak, and then the slightest whispered observation was audible."
"I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing."
"I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep."
The selected passion of the soul of Raymond was ambition.
But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.
"The forest was dressed in green; the young calves frisked on the new sprung grass; the wind winged shadows of light clouds sped over the green cornfields; the hermit cuckoo repeated his monotonous all hail to the season; the nightingale, bird of love and minion of the evening star, filled the woods with song; while Venus lingered in the warm sunset, and the young green of the trees lay in gentle relief along the clear horizon."
"You must not shut me from all communion with you: do not tell me why you grieve but only say the words, ""I am unhappy,"" and you will feel relieved as if for some time excluded from all intercourse by some magic spell you should suddenly enter again the pale of human sympathy."
My poor sister looked at the counsellor with affright.
"Sorrow doubles the burthen to the bent down back; plants thorns in the unyielding pillow; mingles gall with water; adds saltness to their bitter bread; cloathing them in rags, and strewing ashes on their bare heads."
"My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart forever."
"Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?"
"I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire."
Adrian leaned against the wall.
Woodville for ever rose in glory; and Elinor become more lovely and wise under the lessons of her accomplished lover.
"I had become arrogant, peevish, and above all suspicious."
"A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude."
"""You will ask me,"" continued Evadne, ""what I have done since; why I have not applied for succour to the rich Greeks resident here; why I have not returned to my native country?"
"She threw open her window, which looked on the palace garden."
"Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice."
I prayed them to save even from himself this scion of the noblest family in England.
"When she became a widow, she turned all her thoughts to the educating her son Adrian, second Earl of Windsor, so as to accomplish her ambitious ends; and with his mother's milk he imbibed, and was intended to grow up in the steady purpose of re acquiring his lost crown."
This attack was directed against Raymond and his machinations for the restoration of the monarchy.
"Chapter ""Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends."
"I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now."""
"We came at last, methought, to the brow of a huge cliff that over hung the sea which, troubled by the winds, dashed against its base at a distance."
"Its ponderous mass, blackened stone, and high dome, made it look, not like a temple, but a tomb."
Why am I to give an account of myself?
"""Raymond has prophesied well,"" said Perdita, ""alas, that it should be so our present mode of life cannot continue long, yet I will not be the first to propose alteration."
"""My dear girl,"" he said, ""I have been to blame; but you must pardon me."
"""And my brother?"" ""Is on deck, Madam."""
"""I can offer you no consolation, my friend,"" said he; ""your disaster is irreparable."
His praises were so many adder's stings infixed in my vulnerable breast.
"Among better natures, anguish and dread, the fear of eternal separation, and the awful wonder produced by unprecedented calamity, drew closer the ties of kindred and friendship."
"While the earth lasts, his actions will be recorded with praise."
"But my essay towards bringing her to a saner view of her own situation, did not end here."
"I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt."
"After a short repose I prepared to leave her, that I might endeavour to accomplish her wish."
"The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished."
Each vessel in the mean time brought exhilarating tidings from Greece.
"My sister was struck by my narrative: ""How beyond the imagination of man,"" she exclaimed, ""are the decrees of heaven, wondrous and inexplicable"" ""Foolish girl,"" cried Raymond angrily, ""are you like my valiant soldiers, panic struck?"
It is impossible for you to see the real designer; your instructions must pass through me.
"If we traversed a mountain, Greece, a living map, was spread beneath, her renowned pinnacles cleaving the ether; her rivers threading in silver line the fertile land."
"I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden."
"If misfortune come against us we must fight with her; we must cast her aside, and still go on to find out that which it is our nature to desire."
There was a curious feeling of unreality attached by him to his foreign life in comparison with the years of his youth.
In all this there was a strangeness that attracted and enchanted me.
IS there such a feeling as love at first sight?
"The object of her life was to do him pleasure: it had been so before, but with a difference."
"I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death a state which I feared yet did not understand."
"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me."
"I sat with Perdita and soothed her, by my seeming assent to her wild scheme."
and does he not delight singly in such efforts as manifest his love to all?
"I listened quietly, and when he paused would again pour out my misery in expressions that shewed how far too deep my wounds were for any cure."
"""You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you."
"""What if some little payne the passage have That makes frayle flesh to fear the bitter wave?"
"I was born for something greater than I was and greater I would become; but greatness, at least to my distorted perceptions, was no necessary associate of goodness, and my wild thoughts were unchecked by moral considerations when they rioted in dreams of distinction."
"About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end."
I established myself at his bedside; I never quitted it day or night.
"We became ephemera, to whom the interval between the rising and setting sun was as a long drawn year of common time."
"On returning home, the captain of the steam packet with whom I had agreed to sail, came to tell me, that accidental circumstances hastened his departure, and that, if I went with him, I must come on board at five on the following morning."
"I was struck by his exceeding beauty, and as he spoke to thank me the sweet but melancholy cadence of his voice brought tears into my eyes."
At eleven years of age Diana was his favourite playmate but he already talked the language of love.
"As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose."
She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.
Our dainty fare was often exchanged for blows and imprisonment.
"Ye who are linked by the affectionate ties of nature, companions, friends, lovers fathers, who toil with joy for their offspring; women, who while gazing on the living forms of their children, forget the pains of maternity; children, who neither toil nor spin, but love and are loved ""Oh, that death and sickness were banished from our earthly home that hatred, tyranny, and fear could no longer make their lair in the human heart that each man might find a brother in his fellow, and a nest of repose amid the wide plains of his inheritance that the source of tears were dry, and that lips might no longer form expressions of sorrow."
"I gave the right place to every personage in the groupe, the just balance to every sentiment."
"The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned."
"He had bought it, he said, with danger, and paid for it with toil."
"Even at this early age, he was deep read and imbued with the spirit of high philosophy."
The beatings of my human heart drew me back to blank reality.
Pestilence then made a pause in her death dealing career.
"""And you escaped?"" ""No, but I recovered."""
"I could perceive that, when I recalled my sister's thoughts to her duties in life, she did not listen with the same patience as before."
But in this I am a coward.
During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.
"She did not appear to understand him, but smiled."
O wherefore are love and ruin for ever joined in this our mortal dream?
"Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me."
"As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered."
She had not confided in me; I could not demand an explanation from Raymond without the hazard of betraying what was perhaps her most treasured secret.
"But that country had so many resources in the way of agriculture, that the rush of population from one part of it to another, and its increase through foreign emigration, was less felt than with us."
"No matter: I do not wish to plead my cause before any of them, not even before your Lordship, had you not first discovered me."
"""I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers."
"The plague at Athens had been preceded and caused by the contagion from the East; and the scene of havoc and death continued to be acted there, on a scale of fearful magnitude."
"Believe me, I will never desert life untill this last hope is torn from my bosom, that in some way my labours may form a link in the chain of gold with which we ought all to strive to drag Happiness from where she sits enthroned above the clouds, now far beyond our reach, to inhabit the earth with us."
"Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke."
"""Nevertheless, I will try it,"" said my companion; ""it may lead to the real cavern."
"Some erect and manly spirits still remained, pillars of state; but the word republic had grown stale to the vulgar ear; and many the event would prove whether it was a majority pined for the tinsel and show of royalty."
"I did not wish to refuse them; but in my heart of hearts, I made a vow to devote life, knowledge, and power, all of which, in as much as they were of any value, he had bestowed on me all, all my capacities and hopes, to him alone I would devote."
"Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude."
"Raymond and I made a part of the concert, and Adrian and Perdita were devout listeners."
"Although the real interest of my narration is now ended and I ought quickly to wind up its melancholy catastrophe, yet I will relate one instance of my sad suspicion and despair and how Woodville with the goodness and almost the power of an angel, softened my rugged feelings and led me back to gentleness."
"""As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition."
"Notwithstanding my lawless habits, my disposition was sociable, hers recluse."
"After a succession of these, which our resolution alone permitted us to surmount, we arrived at a wide cavern with an arched dome like roof."
My father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.
The northern breeze as it refreshed me was sweeter and more balmy for it seemed to carry some of your spirit along with it.
"I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes."
"My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists."
"If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death."
"""One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books."
"We were set down at St. Bartholomew's, and entered the wretched precincts of the house of disease."
"O, for some medicinal vial to purge unwholesome nature, and bring back the earth to its accustomed health Ryland was a man of strong intellects and quick and sound decision in the usual course of things, but he stood aghast at the multitude of evils that gathered round us."
Hereafter this will be the cynosure of Greece.
"I was perplexed, and most anxious to know what this portended; ah, what could it portend but ruin I saw little of my father during this interval, but he appeared calmer although not less unhappy than before."
The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.
Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?
"He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European."
Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.
"She communicated her gaiety to us, and as we amused ourselves on the Castle Terrace, it appeared that a happier, less care worn party could not have been assembled."
Shall I respect man when he condemns me?
"On the last day, two candidates only were allowed to remain; and to obviate, if possible, the last struggle between these, a bribe was offered to him who should voluntarily resign his pretensions; a place of great emolument and honour was given him, and his success facilitated at a future election."
"And what is each human being worth, if he do not put forth his strength to aid his fellow creatures?"
"She did him justice; she believed that he felt a tender affection for her; but give a paltry prize to him who in some life pending lottery has calculated on the possession of tens of thousands, and it will disappoint him more than a blank."
With the breaking of morning I was accoutred for my ride.
For long years these are the first days of peace that have visited me.
"Such hope as theirs, we also may entertain Old fable tells us, that this gentle spirit sprung from the box of Pandora, else crammed with evils; but these were unseen and null, while all admired the inspiriting loveliness of young Hope; each man's heart became her home; she was enthroned sovereign of our lives, here and here after; she was deified and worshipped, declared incorruptible and everlasting."
"I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, ""By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict."
"Wretched beings crawled to die under our succouring roof; the inhabitants of the Castle decreased daily, while the survivors huddled together in fear, and, as in a famine struck boat, the sport of the wild, interminable waves, each looked in the other's face, to guess on whom the death lot would next fall."
"During the pathetic appeal with which it concludes, a stifled sob attracted our attention to Perdita, the cessation of the music recalled her to herself, she hastened out of the hall I followed her."
"And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine mine to protect, love, and cherish."
"I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval."
"His name as Protector was the burthen of every tongue; his achievements, projects, and magnificence, the argument of every story."
"At day break I hastened to the woods; the hours past on while I indulged in wild dreams that gave wings to the slothful steps of time, and beguiled my eager impatience."
"I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours."
"Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome."
"Alas my companion did, and I was precipitated in his fall."
"When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees."
"My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak."
"He hastened to take me aside, and disclosed to me with rapidity his plan of emigration from England."
"It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart."
"His wife was one of those wondrous beings, to be found only among women, with affections not to be diminished by misfortune."
Wild beyond the imagination of the happy are the thoughts bred by misery and despair.
Then I wandered from the fancies of others and formed affections and intimacies with the aerial creations of my own brain but still clinging to reality I gave a name to these conceptions and nursed them in the hope of realization.
A strange story was rife here.
Why did dark night adorn herself with stars man saw them not?
"But they were ever together and their happiness seemed that of Paradise: they studied together: formed plans of future occupations, and drinking in love and joy from each other's eyes and words they hardly repined at the delay to their entire union."
"In the hurry of the moment I forgot that I was in Greece, and in my native accents endeavoured to soothe the sufferer."
"If he were truly my friend he would have calculated all this; and let me now calculate this boasted friendship, and discover its real worth."
"At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast."
His protectorate was to be distinguished by every kind of innovation on the aristocracy.
You have cast yourself from among us and you wither on this wild plain forlorn and helpless: some dreadful calamity must have befallen you.
"It required hands stronger than mine; stronger I do believe than any human force to break the thick, adamantine chain that has bound me, once breathing nothing but joy, ever possessed by a warm love delight in goodness, to misery only to be ended, and now about to be ended, in death."
"Patience, gentleness, and untired affection, shall recall him, if it be true, as Raymond says, that he is mad; energy and courage shall rescue him, if he be unjustly imprisoned."
Would they dare wrong him thus?
"Will you tell him that he must excuse me to day, for I am not well."
His life was swallowed up in the existence of his beloved; and his heart beat only in unison with the pulsations that vivified hers.
I was alone the whole evening.
"That drink will plunge us in a sweet slumber, and when we awaken what joy will be ours to find all our sorrows and fears past."
"She had just entered her twentieth year, and she and her lover were obliged to submit to this delay."
"This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room."
"At length we reached the overhanging beach; a cottage stood beside the path; we knocked at the door and it was opened: the bed within instantly caught my eye; something stiff and straight lay on it, covered by a sheet; the cottagers looked aghast."
"My poor love and I looked at each other, and our babes."
I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.
"While every mind was full of dismay at its effects, a craving for excitement had led us to peruse De Foe's account, and the masterly delineations of the author of Arthur Mervyn."
"The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair."
The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
"""This is mockery,"" I replied, ""you devote yourself, you, the adored brother of Idris, the being, of all the world contains, dearest to our hearts you devote yourself to an early death."
"His enthusiasm for good which did not exist; his contempt for the sacredness of authority; his ardour and imprudence were all at the antipodes of the usual routine of life; the worldly feared him; the young and inexperienced did not understand the lofty severity of his moral views, and disliked him as a being different from themselves."
"I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: ""Unhappy man Do you share my madness?"
But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.
He came by sea from Constantinople to Athens.
He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best; and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.
"I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave."
Perhaps he did this because he saw a cloud upon Perdita's brow.
Raymond promised; but then a new discussion ensued.
"As I waited for the carriage I walked up and down with a quick pace; then kneeling and passionately clasping my hands I tried to pray but my voice was choked by convulsive sobs Oh the sun shone, the air was balmy he must yet live for if he were dead all would surely be black as night to me The motion of the carriage knowing that it carried me towards him and that I might perhaps find him alive somewhat revived my courage: yet I had a dreadful ride."
"""Shame on the country,"" said Ryland, ""to lay so much stress upon words and frippery; it is a question of nothing; of the new painting of carriage pannels and the embroidery of footmen's coats."""
"The evil is come home to us, and we must not shrink from our fate."
"We, in our retirement, remained long in ignorance of her misfortune."
The lower and vagabond English joined with them.
"He repined for the loss of what was more necessary to him than air or food the excitements of pleasure, the admiration of the noble, the luxurious and polished living of the great."
"As we advanced, we were met by bands of peasantry, whose almost naked condition, whose despair and horror, told at once the fierce nature of the coming enemy."
"The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm."
"At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity."
What was my destination?
My improvement was his delight; he was with me during all my studies and assisted or joined with me in every lesson.
"He was like a poet of old whom the muses had crowned in his cradle, and on whose lips bees had fed."
"Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention."
Beloved and venerable parent He still remained to me.
"He raised his eyes from the ground, but still turning them away from me, said: ""Besought by that plea I will answer your rash question."
"He descended the hill with a face beaming with triumph, and pointing with his sword to the gates, commanded his troops to down with those barricades the only obstacles now to completest victory."
"I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved."
While there is life there is action and change.
"But now my boasted independence was daily instigating me to acts of tyranny, and freedom was becoming licentiousness."
He was now our Lord Protector.
"Whatever I was about to reply, was interrupted by the powerful emotions of Clara."
I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator.
"The plague was forgotten, in this new fear which the black sun had spread; and, though the dead multiplied, and the streets of Ispahan, of Pekin, and of Delhi were strewed with pestilence struck corpses, men passed on, gazing on the ominous sky, regardless of the death beneath their feet."
"Her pallet and easel were now thrown aside; did she try to paint, thronging recollections made her hand tremble, her eyes fill with tears."
On one side was a small opening.
"According to the vulgar superstition, my dress, my person, the air I breathed, bore in it mortal danger to myself and others."
"All events, at the same time that they deeply interested me, arranged themselves in pictures before me."
"The two forces mingling, unarmed and hand in hand, talking only how each might assist the other, the adversaries conjoined; each repenting, the one side their former cruelties, the other their late violence, they obeyed the orders of the General to proceed towards London."
She had to play the part of a courteous hostess; to attend to all; to shine the focus of enjoyment and grace.
"Farewell, my only living friend; you are the sole tie that binds me to existence, and now I break it."
"I will see him to morrow if he wishes it, and you also."
Late in the evening she entered the apartments appropriated to the festival.
"Though Constantinople be heaped above him as a tomb, yet I must find him then cover us with the city's weight, with a mountain piled above I care not, so that one grave hold Raymond and his Perdita."""
"The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe."
Raymond's answer was brief.
"Such a tale filled the trumpet of many voiced fame; such a tale rendered my longer stay at Vienna, away from the friend of my youth, intolerable."
But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.
"He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone."
"It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice."
"The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion."
He had traced the man to one of the most penurious streets in the metropolis.
Clara and Alfred followed.
In no one moment of coming time did I feel as I had done in time gone by.
"I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure."
"Her mother, all eyes and ears, soon interrupted us; and I saw, that she wished to dismiss me quietly, as one whose services, now that his relatives had arrived, were of no use to her son."
My sister's heightened colour and sparkling eyes half revealed her secret to me.
"Thus, notwithstanding the thoughtless delight that waited on its commencement, the impression I have of my life at Vienna is melancholy."
She feared to lose sight of him; yet she dreaded to remark any change in the temper of his mind.
"Why should this be, if HE were not good?"
She accused herself of his journey to Greece his dangers his imprisonment.
"Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country."
This is no sudden fancy; I live by it.
"But let us go; to morrow we will arrange to ride out together, and proceeding towards that part of the forest, call upon him."""
My father was very little changed from what he described himself to be before his misfortunes.
"Relations of what he had done, conjectures concerning his future actions, were the never failing topics of the hour."
"He often thanked us for the books we lent him, and for the use of our instruments, but never spoke of his altered abode or change of circumstances."
"He talked of general subjects, and gave me ideas I had never before conceived."
"I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding place, and went in search of food."
I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves.
"When he conversed with me his manner was cold and constrained; his eyes only seemed to speak, and as he turned their black, full lustre towards me they expressed a living sadness."
"While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes."
"I lay on the ground, and giving the reins to my thoughts, repassed in my mind my former life; and began, fold by fold, to unwind the many errors of my heart, and to discover how brutish, savage, and worthless I had hitherto been."
It gives me no pain to leave you; nor can our seperation give you much.
I pored over the poetry of old times; I studied the metaphysics of Plato and Berkeley.
"The student left his books, the artist his study: the occupations of life were gone, but the amusements remained; enjoyment might be protracted to the verge of the grave."
My thoughts were gems to enrich the treasure house of man's intellectual possessions; each sentiment was a precious gift I bestowed on them.
All this has a different effect upon Raymond.
Wherefore should this be?

At first he refused to stay to hear her.
"The love that is the soul of friendship is a soft spirit seldom found except when two amiable creatures are knit from early youth, or when bound by mutual suffering and pursuits; it comes to some of the elect unsought and unaware; it descends as gentle dew on chosen spots which however barren they were before become under its benign influence fertile in all sweet plants; but when desired it flies; it scoffs at the prayers of its votaries; it will bestow, but not be sought."

"She was pale and fair, and her golden hair clustered on her temples, contrasting its rich hue with the living marble beneath."

"The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands."

"The solution that seemed to me the most probable was that during his residence in London he had fallen in love with some unworthy person, and that his passion mastered him although he would not gratify it: he loved me too well to sacrifise me to this inclination, and that he had now visited this house that by reviving the memory of my mother whom he so passionately adored he might weaken the present impression."
"Is not love a divinity, because it is immortal?"
I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.
"When I returned to Perdita, I found that she had already been informed of the success of my undertaking."

"Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever."
One other incident occurred at the end of this summer.
"I, driven half mad, as I met party after party of the country people, in their holiday best, descending the hills, escaped to their cloud veiled summits, and looking on the sterile rocks about me, exclaimed ""They do not cry, long live the Earl"" Nor, when night came, accompanied by drizzling rain and cold, would I return home; for I knew that each cottage rang with the praises of Adrian; as I felt my limbs grow numb and chill, my pain served as food for my insane aversion; nay, I almost triumphed in it, since it seemed to afford me reason and excuse for my hatred of my unheeding adversary."

"Why dost thou howl thus, O wind?"
"Tell me, can I do nothing?"

"M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me."
"I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me.

"I found Merrival, the astronomer, with her."
"Soon her door opened softly, and on her springing up, she heard a whisper, ""Not asleep yet,"" and the door again closed."
The Irish followed their track in disorganized multitudes; each day encreasing; each day becoming more lawless.
I journied all day; every moment my misery encreased and the fever of my blood became intolerable.
No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.
"The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal."
"This was certainly the Sibyl's Cave; not indeed exactly as Virgil describes it, but the whole of this land had been so convulsed by earthquake and volcano, that the change was not wonderful, though the traces of ruin were effaced by time; and we probably owed the preservation of these leaves, to the accident which had closed the mouth of the cavern, and the swift growing vegetation which had rendered its sole opening impervious to the storm."

She answered the one with a gush of tears telling me that to be persuaded life and the goods of life were a cheap exchange.
"And all this, to be sure, was delicately put; not in broad words for my feelings might be hurt but Whispered so and so In dark hint soft and lowE with downcast eyes, and sympathizing smiles or whimpers; and I listened with quiet countenance while every nerve trembled; I that dared not utter aye or no to all this blasphemy."

"Idris could not refrain from a smile, as she listened; she had already gathered from him that his family was alive and in health; though not apt to forget the precipice of time on which she stood, yet I could perceive that she was amused for a moment, by the contrast between the contracted view we had so long taken of human life, and the seven league strides with which Merrival paced a coming eternity."
"His passions, always his masters, acquired fresh strength, from the long sleep in which love had cradled them, the clinging weight of destiny bent him down; he was goaded, tortured, fiercely impatient of that worst of miseries, the sense of remorse."
I have loved thee; and in my days both of happiness and sorrow I have peopled your solitudes with wild fancies of my own creation.
I am placed in the most difficult circumstances.
"Let me find the earthly dwelling of my beloved; let us rescue that from common dust, so that in times to come men may point to the sacred tomb, and name it his then to other thoughts, and a new course of life, or what else fate, in her cruel tyranny, may have marked out for me."""

"Why should he lose this, now that added years, prudence, and the pledge which his marriage gave to his country, ought to encrease, rather than diminish his claims to confidence?"
"The dissecting room and the slaughter house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion."

"He, her beloved, the sole and eternal object of her passionate tenderness, was restored her."

"With a beating heart she expected another visit, and when after an interval her chamber was again invaded, having first assured herself that the intruders were her mother and an attendant, she composed herself to feigned sleep."

"I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished."

On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.
"""You clothe your meaning, Perdita,"" I replied, ""in powerful words, yet that meaning is selfish and unworthy of you."

"With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus."
"I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years."

"September nd My beloved Sister, I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it."
"I concealed from this beloved child that her mother's death was voluntary, and tried every means to awaken cheerfulness in her sorrow stricken spirit."
"No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only."
"But these fluctuations shook to its depths the soul of the sensitive youth; he no longer deemed the world subject to him, because he possessed Evadne's love; he felt in every nerve that the dire storms of the mental universe were about to attack his fragile being, which quivered at the expectation of its advent."
"Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me."
"But winter was coming, and with winter, hope."
"But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?"

"I have learnt in Greece that one man, more or less, is of small import, while human bodies remain to fill up the thinned ranks of the soldiery; and that the identity of an individual may be overlooked, so that the muster roll contain its full numbers."
"As this state of wretchedness became more confirmed, and, in spite of her endeavours at concealment more apparent, I strove, though vainly, to awaken in her courage and hope."
"""Even so,"" he cried, ""I knew you would speak of her."
"All my joy turned to sorrow when I first beheld him with that melancholy countenance enter these doors as it were the day after my lady's funeral He seemed to recover himself a little after he had bidden me write to you but still it is a woful thing to see him so unhappy."""
"I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task."
"Evadne's constancy, fortitude, even her ill fated and ill regulated love, were matter of admiration and pity; especially when, from the detail of the events of the nineteenth of October, it was apparent that she preferred suffering and death to any in her eyes degrading application for the pity and assistance of her lover."
"Love had doubled all her excellencies, and placed a diadem on her genius."
It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.
"I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father's happiness, my adversary's designs against my life should not retard it a single hour."

"What slave will not, if he may, escape from his chains?"
"I felt as if, from the order of the systematic world, I had plunged into chaos, obscure, contrary, unintelligible."

"He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends."
"She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian."

"On examination, we found that all the leaves, bark, and other substances, were traced with written characters."
"Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate."
"Often I waited beside the bed of death till midnight, and through the obscurity of rainy, cloudy nights rode many miles, sustained by one circumstance only, the safety and sheltered repose of those I loved."
"A remembrance of the discourses of my parents, and the communications which my mother endeavoured to impress upon me concerning my father's friends, in slight hope that I might one day derive benefit from the knowledge, floated like an indistinct dream through my brain."

"""You have got up all your arguments in excellent order,"" I replied; ""and, if Adrian consent, they are unanswerable."
"Idris stood beside me, her dear hand locked in mine."
"He gave not only a brief denial to his mother's schemes, but published his intention of using his influence to diminish the power of the aristocracy, to effect a greater equalization of wealth and privilege, and to introduce a perfect system of republican government into England."
"Once Idris named me casually a frown, a convulsive gesture of anger, shook her mother, and, with voice trembling with hate, she said ""I am of little worth in this world; the young are impatient to push the old off the scene; but, Idris, if you do not wish to see your mother expire at your feet, never again name that person to me; all else I can bear; and now I am resigned to the destruction of my cherished hopes: but it is too much to require that I should love the instrument that providence gifted with murderous properties for my destruction."""
"Her timidity was not artificial, but arose from that fear of not being properly appreciated, that slight estimation of the neglect of the world, which also characterized Raymond."
I asked her where he should be buried.

"When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love."
You will not dispute with me?
"""There needs no persuasion,"" said the blushing Perdita, ""except your own dear promises, and my ready heart, which whispers to me that they are true."""
"I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight."
"This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue."
"His mother, apparently inattentive, at once understood what was meant, and seeing the hold we had upon her, yielded the point to us."
"He pointed out the errors, and the alterations that he wished to be made; he offered the Greek a pencil that he might correct the sketch on the spot; this was refused by his visitor, who said that he perfectly understood, and would work at it at home."

But it is unworthy of me to argue and complain.
Tragedies deep and dire were the chief favourites.

"A restlessness, a fear of what was about to betide, a doubt as to Raymond's purposes, urged me to return without delay to his quarters."
"It was this that led me here: I thought that if I could again awaken in my heart the grief I had felt at the loss of your mother, and the many associations with her memory which had been laid to sleep for seventeen years, that all love for her child would become extinct."

He had promised to spend some hours with me one afternoon but a violent and continual rain prevented him.
"A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness."
Who ordered your attack?

"""It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire."
"We approached with all the speed six rowers could give; the orderly and picturesque dress of the soldiers on the beach, the sounds of exulting music, the stirring breeze and waving flags, the unchecked exclamations of the eager crowd, whose dark looks and foreign garb were purely eastern; the sight of temple crowned rock, the white marble of the buildings glittering in the sun, and standing in bright relief against the dark ridge of lofty mountains beyond; the near roar of the sea, the splash of oars, and dash of spray, all steeped my soul in a delirium, unfelt, unimagined in the common course of common life."
Who deserved the hand of this self exalted king more than she whose glance belonged to a queen of nations?
"But a bitter thought swiftly shadowed her joy; she bent her eyes on the ground, endeavouring to master the passion of tears that threatened to overwhelm her."

I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathize with and love me.
"Raymond adduced many arguments and fervent persuasions to overcome her feeling, but she remained unconvinced; and, agitated by the discussion, she wildly and passionately made a solemn vow, to fly and hide herself where he never could discover her, where famine would soon bring death to conclude her woes, if he persisted in his to her disgracing offers."

"Not the wild, raving most miserable Mathilda but a youthful Hermitess dedicated to seclusion and whose bosom she must strive to keep free from all tumult and unholy despair The fanciful nunlike dress that I had adopted; the knowledge that my very existence was a secret known only to myself; the solitude to which I was for ever hereafter destined nursed gentle thoughts in my wounded heart."

"My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country."

"These thoughts encouraged Raymond, as he stood at the door of the highest room of the house."
"Lord Raymond requested permission to accompany her to Windsor Castle, to which she consented, and they quitted the cottage together."
"They were not expressed in words, nor even reduced to form in my own mind; but they filled my soul, exalting my thoughts, raising a glow of enthusiasm, and led me out of the obscure path in which I before walked, into the bright noon enlightened highway of mankind, making me, citizen of the world, a candidate for immortal honors, an eager aspirant to the praise and sympathy of my fellow men."

In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.
"The leafless trees spread their fibrous branches against the pure sky; their intricate and pervious tracery resembled delicate sea weed; the deer were turning up the snow in search of the hidden grass; the white was made intensely dazzling by the sun, and trunks of the trees, rendered more conspicuous by the loss of preponderating foliage, gathered around like the labyrinthine columns of a vast temple; it was impossible not to receive pleasure from the sight of these things."
His first wish was aggrandisement; and the means that led towards this end were secondary considerations.

"Yes, you are the sole, the agonizing cause of all I suffer, of all I must suffer untill I die."
"But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine."
She saw that he was endowed with genius and surpassing talent; these she cultivated for the sake of afterwards using them for the furtherance of her own views.
"Nor shall you, my friend; cheer up; cease to weep, I entreat you."
In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.
"Write, dearest Victor, one line one word will be a blessing to us."
"But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin."
"""After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart broken and overcome."
She welcomed me with the greatest affection.

At length the thought of you crossed my mind.
"During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame."
"The flood and storms did more harm to continental Europe than to us giving, as it were, the last blow to the calamities which destroyed it."

"Nature grows old, and shakes in her decaying limbs, creation has become bankrupt What wonder then, that eclipse and death have led to destruction the light of thy life, O Perdita"" CHAPTER IX."

"One evening, quitting our inn, we strolled down a shady lane, then up a grassy slope, till we came to an eminence, that commanded an extensive view of hill and dale, meandering rivers, dark woods, and shining villages."
"The silence of midnight, to speak truly, though apparently a paradox, rung in my ears."
Will you accompany me to Windsor to morrow?
We first came upon a few stragglers of the Irish at St. Albans.
"They hurried away, as soon as they saw me; my agitated mien added to their fear of coming near one who had entered within the verge of contagion."
The last action at which I was present was the taking of .
"They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards."

"I repassed, in my memory, my whole life my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt."
"That Idris, the princely born, nursling of wealth and luxury, should have come through the tempestuous winter night from her regal abode, and standing at my lowly door, conjure me to fly with her through darkness and storm was surely a dream again her plaintive tones, the sight of her loveliness assured me that it was no vision."
"After some observations on the scenery and seats, Raymond said: ""Philosophers have called man a microcosm of nature, and find a reflection in the internal mind for all this machinery visibly at work around us."
He loved her for her beauty and for her amiable disposition but he seemed to love her more for what he considered her superior wisdom.

"""Get well and return to us."
"What a brimful cup of joyful agony it was, when his face first gleamed with the glance of recognition when he pressed my hand, now more fevered than his own, and when he pronounced my name No trace of his past insanity remained, to dash my joy with sorrow."
"What though those limbs moved not, and those lips could no more frame modulated accents of wisdom and love What though like a weed flung from the fruitless sea, he lay the prey of corruption still that was the form she had caressed, those the lips that meeting hers, had drank the spirit of love from the commingling breath; that was the earthly mechanism of dissoluble clay she had called her own."
"The buds decked the trees, the flowers adorned the land: the dark branches, swollen with seasonable juices, expanded into leaves, and the variegated foliage of spring, bending and singing in the breeze, rejoiced in the genial warmth of the unclouded empyrean: the brooks flowed murmuring, the sea was waveless, and the promontories that over hung it were reflected in the placid waters; birds awoke in the woods, while abundant food for man and beast sprung up from the dark ground."
"She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart."
These were dreadful fears and they even haunted my dreams.
"Idris is a gentle, pretty, sweet little girl; it is impossible not to have an affection for her, and I have a very sincere one; only do not speak of love love, the tyrant and the tyrant queller; love, until now my conqueror, now my slave; the hungry fire, the untameable beast, the fanged snake no no I will have nothing to do with that love."

"At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence."
"Be proud of me, and cherish your infant remembrance of me."
"Dreadful as the time was when I pursued my father towards the ocean, found their sic only his lifeless corpse; yet for my own sake I should prefer that to the watching one by one his senses fade; his pulse weaken and sleeplessly as it were devour his life in gazing."
"Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate."
"I turned angrily away: ""Verney,"" said Adrian, ""you are very cynical: sit down; or if you will not, perhaps, as you are not a frequent visitor, Lord Raymond will humour you, and accompany us, as we had previously agreed upon, to parliament."""
"From him she sprung, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone and not, as heretofore, are you content to trace in her downy cheek and delicate limbs, an affinity to Raymond, but in her enthusiastic affections, in the sweet qualities of her mind, you may still find him living, the good, the great, the beloved."
"His wit, his bon mots, the record of his personal attractions, fascinating manners, and social talents, were long remembered and repeated from mouth to mouth."
"Farewell, Perdita farewell, poor girl never again will you see yourself thus; luxury and wealth are no longer yours; in the excess of your poverty you may envy the homeless beggar; most truly am I without a home I live on a barren desart, which, wide and interminable, brings forth neither fruit or flower; in the midst is a solitary rock, to which thou, Perdita, art chained, and thou seest the dreary level stretch far away."""
"His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected."
His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
"Agatha, the ever gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came."
At length it was mentioned in the newspapers.
Woodville was obliged to make a journey into the country and was detained from day to day in irksome absence from his lovely bride.
"Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable."
Could he be I shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother?
"Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?"
"The same half disdainful lips and smile of triumph, the same intelligent eyes, the same brow and chestnut hair; her very hands and taper fingers resembled his."
"As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground."
"The very beauty of the Grecian climate, during the season of spring, added torture to her sensations."
"And then he devoutly loved Perdita; the bend of her head, her glossy ringlets, the turn of her form were to him subjects of deep tenderness and admiration; as she spoke, her melodious tones entered his soul; he soon softened towards her, comforting and caressing her, and endeavouring to cheat himself into the belief that he had never wronged her."
"But soon the dim orb passed from over the sun, and lingered down the eastern heaven."
"""Do not degrade me in my own eyes,"" she said; ""poverty has long been my nurse; hard visaged she is, but honest."
The events that immediately followed on my arrival at Windsor changed this view of things.
On earth I thought that I had well fulfilled my trial my last moments became peaceful with the reflection that I deserved no blame but you take from me that feeling My passions were there my all to me and the hopeless misery that possessed me shut all love all images of beauty from my soul Nature was to me as the blackest night if rays of loveliness ever strayed into my darkness it was only to draw bitter tears of hopeless anguish from my eyes Oh on earth what consolation is there to misery?
"Looking timidly around, as if she feared to be overheard, she whispered: ""I have discovered to morrow that is, to day already the to morrow is come before dawn, foreigners, Austrians, my mother's hirelings, are to carry me off to Germany, to prison, to marriage to anything, except you and my brother take me away, or soon they will be here"" I was frightened by her vehemence, and imagined some mistake in her incoherent tale; but I no longer hesitated to obey her."
"I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities forever."
The following morning Lord Raymond visited me early.
Will you accompany me?
"My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon."
"I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept."
You are grieved and there is grief in the expression of your countenance but it is gentle and sweet.
"In crowded cities, among cultivated plains, or on the desart mountains, pain is thickly sown, and if we can tear up but one of these noxious weeds, or more, if in its stead we can sow one seed of corn, or plant one fair flower, let that be motive sufficient against suicide."
They were grass grown and desert.
"Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit."""
"Your own delicacy will not allow you, I am convinced, to attempt to trace me."
"I wandered for ever about these lovely solitudes, gathering flower after flower Ond' era pinta tutta la mia viaB singing as I might the wild melodies of the country, or occupied by pleasant day dreams."
"But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man."
She grew capricious; her gentle conduct towards him was exchanged for asperity and repulsive coldness.
Life was then brilliant; I began to learn to hope and what brings a more bitter despair to the heart than hope destroyed?
"The stars came out, shedding their ineffectual glimmerings on the light widowed earth."
"Good night, my sister."
But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.
"Night closed in, and it began to rain."
I often thought that I would instantly return and take you along with me to some fertile island where we should live at peace for ever.
"It was only when he was absent from me that his passion subdued him, that he clinched his hands knit his brows and with haggard looks called for death to his despair, raving wildly, untill exhausted he sank down nor was revived untill I joined him."
"She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise."
"Perceiving the weakness of Raymond, I was afraid of ill consequences from the pressure of the crowd on his landing."
"""I do not know,"" said the man, ""what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains."""
"Some were royalists from prejudice and ancient affection, and there were many moderately inclined who feared alike the capricious tyranny of the popular party, and the unbending despotism of the aristocrats."
"Men made perilous journies to possess themselves of earth's splendid trifles, gems and gold."
"Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?"
"For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright."
"I cannot describe the rapturous delight with which I turned from political brawls at home, and the physical evils of distant countries, to my own dear home, to the selected abode of goodness and love; to peace, and the interchange of every sacred sympathy."
His passage to power had been full of pain to both.
"""Merrival,"" I said, ""it is long since we have seen you you must return to Windsor with me Lady Idris desires to see you, you will not refuse her request come home with me."""
"In his amendment he proposed, that an exception should be made in the bill in favour of any person who claimed the sovereign power in right of the earls of Windsor."
One by one these symptoms struck me; I became convinced that the moment I had so much desired was about to arrive and that I was dying.
We took leave of them in the Protectoral Palace.
"I saw Lord Raymond on his charger; a small company of officers had gathered about him; and behind was a promiscuous concourse of soldiers and subalterns, their discipline lost, their arms thrown aside; no music sounded, no banners streamed."
All the ex queen's friends were his friends; no week passed that he did not hold consultations with her at Windsor.
"We come,"" he exclaimed, springing forwards, ""for what should we wait?"
"I pressed it to my lips, while the rough soldiers gathered around, mourning over this worthiest prey of death, as if regret and endless lamentation could re illumine the extinguished spark, or call to its shattered prison house of flesh the liberated spirit."
"""Alas My father,"" said I, ""how little do you know me."
"We visited the so called Elysian Fields and Avernus: and wandered through various ruined temples, baths, and classic spots; at length we entered the gloomy cavern of the Cumaean Sibyl."
"At first indeed this wanton spirit played a false part appearing with sable wings gloomy countenance seemed to take a pleasure in exagerating all my miseries and as small hopes arose to snatch them from me give me in their place gigantic fears which under her fairy hand appeared close, impending unavoidable sometimes she would cruelly leave me while I was thus on the verge of madness and without consoling me leave me nought but heavy leaden sleep but at other times she would wilily link less unpleasing thoughts to these most dreadful ones before I was aware place hopes before me futile but consoling One day this lovely spirit whose name as she told me was Fantasia came to me in one of her consolotary moods her wings which seemed coloured by her tone of mind were not gay but beautiful like that of the partridge her lovely eyes although they ever burned with an unquenshable fire were shaded softened by her heavy lids the black long fringe of her eye lashes She thus addressed me You mourn for the loss of those you love."
"He easily eluded me and said, ""Be calm I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head."
I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.
"She had lived for some years in an alms house, and on fine Sundays her threshold was constantly beset by a crowd, seeking her advice and listening to her admonitions."
"I had the newspaper in my hand, and, as usual, had turned to the intelligence from Greece."
"Raymond looked keenly at him; he could read benignity only in his gentle lineaments; he turned to me, observing with scorn my moody and stern demeanour."
"If you can never be happy, can you never bestow happiness?"
"Certainly the Ryland that advanced towards us now, bore small resemblance to the powerful, ironical, seemingly fearless canvasser for the first rank among Englishmen."
"At all events methought that the wound could be healed; and, if they remained together, it would be so."
"When she perceived the wild or pathetic appeal of his expressive countenance, she would relent, and for a while resume her ancient kindness."
"But now my mother, or, if you will, my mother's lessons, awaken within me."
"Yet it was less painful to see him thus, than to find him fulfilling the animal functions uninterruptedly, his mind sick the while."
He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.
And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?
"I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, ""I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror."""
But soon I endeavoured to extract patience for her from the ideas she suggested.
"A letter came unawares, Perdita read it."
"""This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house."
"I was indifferent, therefore, to my school fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them."
I have been miserably mistaken in imagining that I could conquer my love for you; I never can.
"When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations."
Ryland had shewn that he preferred him.
"As it was, the sweet girl's generous nature was roused to defend, and ally herself with, my despised cause."
Farewell I must now leave you for a few hours.
"I replied in a calm voice but how far from calm was the thought imaged by my still words ""Never I can never consent that Lady Idris should be united to one who does not love her."" ""Because you love her yourself."""
"Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?"
"Thus this towering spirit who had excited interest and high expectation in all who knew and could value him became at once, as it were, extinct."
"The orphan and neglected son of Verney, was on the eve of being linked to the mechanism of society by a golden chain, and to enter into all the duties and affections of life."
"The foreigners whom we had among us, who had fled from the plague in their own country, now saw their last asylum invaded; and, fear making them garrulous, they described to eager listeners the miseries they had beheld in cities visited by the calamity, and gave fearful accounts of the insidious and irremediable nature of the disease."
Elizabeth's heart rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.
"The poor animal recognised me, licked my hand, crept close to its lord, and died."
He loved her with passion and her tenderness had a charm for him that would not permit him to think of aught but her.
"If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied."
"We cannot calculate on his forces like that of an engine; and, though an impulse draw with a forty horse power at what appears willing to yield to one, yet in contempt of calculation the movement is not effected."
Her voice was suffocated with sobs.
"On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner."
Chapter Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.
"Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?"
"The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations."
All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
A murmur of surprise and horror ran through the assembly.
"And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?"
"You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind."
"She thought he did well to assert his own will, but she wished that will to have been more intelligible to the multitude."
"I must go, Lionel the Gods will it; and I must."
I was silent: all was silent except the roaring of the sea which became louder and more dreadful.
"He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end."
"I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied."
"I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity."
"He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government."
"For many days I have longed to disclose the mysterious presentiments that weigh on me, although I fear that you will ridicule them."
"The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison."
During three months I have been employed in this task.
"From the moment Perdita had sufficiently recovered herself to form any plan of action, she had laid one down, which now she prepared to follow."
"This old woman had reached her hundredth year; her skin was shrivelled, her form was bent and lost in extreme decrepitude; but as still from year to year she continued in existence, out living many younger and stronger, she began to feel as if she were to live for ever."
"The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies."
"Here I may even cease to repine, and may add my tardy consent to the decree which has taken him from me."
"Guileless himself, Adrian feared no deceit."
"Thus, while Raymond had been wrapt in visions of power and fame, while he looked forward to entire dominion over the elements and the mind of man, the territory of his own heart escaped his notice; and from that unthought of source arose the mighty torrent that overwhelmed his will, and carried to the oblivious sea, fame, hope, and happiness."
"He is irrecoverably mad."""
"Was there indeed anarchy in the sublime universe of Adrian's thoughts, did madness scatter the well appointed legions, and was he no longer the lord of his own soul?"
"She leads them to truth wisdom untill the time comes when they shall be fitted for the journey through the universe which all must one day undertake farewell And now, gentlest reader I must beg your indulgence I am a being too weak to record the words of Diotima her matchless wisdom heavenly eloquence."
"Sordid care, avaunt menial labours, and pains, slight in themselves, but too gigantic for our exhausted strength, shall make no part of our ephemeral existences."
"The villages were decorated by triumphal arches of greenery by day, and lamps by night; tapestry waved from the windows, the ground was strewed with flowers, and the name of Raymond, joined to that of Greece, was echoed in the Evive of the peasant crowd."
"Early in the day, Argyropylo was wounded dangerously, and Raymond assumed the command of the whole army."
"How delicious to me were the words of his letter that concerned me: ""I cannot tell you,"" it said, ""how ardently I desire to see my Mathilda."
"Shall I go alone, or will you accompany me?"""
"Until now, my savage habits had done me no radical mischief; my physical powers had grown up and flourished under their influence, and my mind, undergoing the same discipline, was imbued with all the hardy virtues."
The anniversary was at hand of the exaltation of Raymond to the office of Protector; and it was customary to celebrate this day by a splendid festival.
"As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance."
"He had been struck by the fortitude and beauty of the ill fated Greek; and, when her constant tenderness towards him unfolded itself, he asked with astonishment, by what act of his he had merited this passionate and unrequited love."
"She did not in the least resemble either of her children; her black and sparkling eye, lit up by pride, was totally unlike the blue lustre, and frank, benignant expression of either Adrian or Idris."
"Again I am a solitary man; and I will become again, as in my early years, a wanderer, a soldier of fortune."
I was as a solitary spot among mountains shut in on all sides by steep black precipices; where no ray of heat could penetrate; and from which there was no outlet to sunnier fields.
"All I now ask, all your mother, Idris, requests is, that you will not see this upstart during the interval of one month."""
"I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror."
I resolved at length to accompany Perdita.
"Woe befall the day, she thought, woe, tears, and mourning betide the hour, that gave Raymond another hope than love, another wish than my devotion; and thrice joyful the moment when he shall be restored to me God knows, I put my trust in his vows, and believe his asserted faith but for that, I would not seek what I am now resolved to attain."
"He grasped my hand affectionately: ""Thank you,"" he said, ""you have relieved me from a painful dilemma, and are, as you ever were, the best of my friends."
"""But it is true that I am a wretch."
"Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart."
"But your sad mien never alters; your pulses beat and you breathe, yet you seem already to belong to another world; and sometimes, pray pardon my wild thoughts, when you touch my hand I am surprised to find your hand warm when all the fire of life seems extinct within you."
"He discovered the name of the spot whither my father had retreated, and where he died; he learnt the existence of his orphan children; and during the short interval between his arrival at Ulswater and our meeting in the park, he had been occupied in making inquiries concerning us, and arranging a variety of plans for our benefit, preliminary to his introducing himself to our notice."
"He was found stiff, his hands clenched, and pressed against his breast."
No; I am not so selfish.
"Still I think, that time, and even absence, may restore her to me."
It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.
"The autumn was warm and rainy: the infirm and sickly died off happier they: many young people flushed with health and prosperity, made pale by wasting malady, became the inhabitants of the grave."
"He was one of those very few whom fortune favours from their birth; on whom she bestows all gifts of intellect and person with a profusion that knew no bounds, and whom under her peculiar protection, no imperfection however slight, or disappointment however transitory has leave to touch."
"Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends."
My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery.
"""Yes,"" said Elizabeth, ""I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone."""
"But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed."
"I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans."
"Not so Raymond; he was an enchanter, whose reign was for ever undiminished; a king whose power never was suspended: follow him through the details of common life, still the same charm of grace and majesty adorned him; nor could he be despoiled of the innate deification with which nature had invested him."
"When we were together I spoke little yet my selfish mind was sometimes borne away by the rapid course of his ideas; I would lift my eyes with momentary brilliancy until memories that never died and seldom slept would recur, and a tear would dim them."
"I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation."
Death and disease level all men.
She had no experience beyond her father's cottage; and the mansion of the lord of the manor was the chiefest type of grandeur she could conceive.
A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.
We had prepared a banquet for our guests in the lower hall of the castle; and thither Idris and I repaired to receive and entertain the few that remained.
I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.
"""Entertain this belief,"" he cried, ""hug it to your heart make it a pillow to your head, an opiate for your eyes I am content."
"Many living deaths have I borne for thee, O Raymond, and now I expire, thy victim By my death I purchase thee lo the instruments of war, fire, the plague are my servitors."
"Such incursions struck the English with affright, in all those towns where there was still sufficient population to feel the change."
"The high walls of the tomb, and the flaming sword of plague, lie between it and him."
"The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it."
"Why my sic does my heart heave with vain endeavour to cast aside the bitter anguish that covers it ""as the waters cover the sea."""
Alas it was double cruelty in him to have chosen the sea for his fatal resolve; it was adding madness to my despair.
"The name of the king, he to whom my dying father had addressed his latest prayers, and who had barbarously slighted them, was associated only with the ideas of unkindness, injustice, and consequent resentment."
Yet let me a little retract from this sentence I have passed on myself.
"I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject."
"Were the pride of ancestry, the patrician spirit, the gentle courtesies and refined pursuits, splendid attributes of rank, to be erased among us?"
Social feeling and sympathy constituted a marked feature in my disposition.
"As he spoke, every sound was hushed, every thought suspended by intense attention."
"I started up, my strength returned; sic with my terror; I cried, ""Oh, God Is this thy decree?"
"Burke has said that, 'in all bodies those who would lead, must also, in a considerable degree, follow.'"
I never loved any but you.
"Pardon me, gentle reader, this is not futile vanity; not futile, since to know that Adrian felt thus, brings joy even now to my lone heart."
"She directed everything to be prepared for the continuance of their journey, and placing her lovely sleeping charge on a bed, passed several hours in acute suffering."
"I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony."
"This good woman had stood in the place of a mother, and her very deficiencies of education and knowledge, by rendering her humble and defenceless, endeared her to us she was the especial favourite of the children."
"We conjectured, notwithstanding what we had heard, that we should find Raymond in St. Stephen's: thither we sped."
"He felt assured, after he had for awhile humoured her self will, that in the end friendship and reason would gain the day."
"I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires."
I tell you we are no longer miserable mortals; we are about to become Gods; spirits free and happy as gods.
The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
"The plain around was interspersed with cemeteries, Turk, Greek, and Armenian, with their growth of cypress trees; and other woods of more cheerful aspect, diversified the scene."
"""All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us."
She had grown thin and pale; and her eyes often filled with tears.
"If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies."
"Turning to him, therefore, I said, ""I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile."""
"Her only consolation during the violence which she did herself, was to watch the motions of an illuminated clock, and internally count the moments which must elapse before she could be alone."
"The sight of the military restored hope to those who fled, and revenge took place of fear."
"Then I should have lived upon this dreary heath unvisited, and blasting none by my unhallowed gaze."
"""In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close Oh, Frankenstein Generous and self devoted being What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?"
"He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided."
"At least it would be a benevolent action to rescue the sufferer, whether human or brute, from the desolation of the town; so, sending Clara back to her home, I again entered Constantinople."
"Perdita rejoined him, and before her he forced himself to appear cheerful, for she, even as a mirror, changed as he changed, and if he were silent and anxious, she solicitously inquired concerning, and endeavoured to remove the cause of his seriousness."
Near the fire was Ryland and his supporters.
"Day after day so many hundreds wore on; they brought no outward changes with them, but some few slowly operated on my mind as I glided on towards death."
"She regarded with suspicion the invitation of Idris; she embraced me, as if she were about to be deprived of my affection also: calling me her more than brother, her only friend, her last hope, she pathetically conjured me not to cease to love her; and with encreased anxiety she departed for London, the scene and cause of all her misery."
"You who have dedicated your powers of mind and fortune to the benefit of your species, shall you so misdirect your exertions, as to support in uselessness the strong, healthy, and capable?"""
"At last, with slow and heavy steps, I had paced out of the hall, and sprung upon my horse."
"I clung to my ferocious habits, yet half despised them; I continued my war against civilization, and yet entertained a wish to belong to it."
But my father; my beloved and most wretched father?
No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.
"""She will of course, as I shall her, when we are married."""
"You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife."
We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.
"Turning her thoughts this way, I gave them an object which rescued them from insanity."
"She had never been married; and for the last five years had lived perfectly alone on an estate, that had descended to her through her mother, on the shores of Loch Lomond in Scotland."
"When I came to the reality, and saw regiments file off to the left far out of sight, fields intervening between the battalions, but a few troops sufficiently near me to observe their motions, I gave up all idea of understanding, even of seeing a battle, but attaching myself to Raymond attended with intense interest to his actions."
"There she would behold the tomb of her parents, and the territory filled with recollections of her father's glory."
The ward was filled with an effluvia that caused my heart to heave with painful qualms.
"Once for a moment she revived and recognized his voice; a smile, a last lovely smile, played upon her lips."
"With shuddering horror I veiled this monument of human passion and human misery; I heaped over her all of flags and heavy accoutrements I could find, to guard her from birds and beasts of prey, until I could bestow on her a fitting grave."
I felt a holy rapture spring from all I saw.
"With her therefore, before me on my horse, attended only by the servant who was to re conduct her, we rode to the Top Kapou."
"We will set up a candidate, and ensure his success."
Whither does this lead?
The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.
He felt that the end of time was come; he knew that one by one we should dwindle into nothingness.
"See you not the thunderbolt fall, and are deafened by the shout of heaven that follows its descent?"
"I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished."
It is a part of man's nature to adapt itself through habit even to pain and sorrow.
"""How inconstant are your feelings But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?"
"I watched the re awakened devotion of my sister; Clara's timid, but concentrated admiration of her father, and Raymond's appetite for renown, and sensitiveness to the demonstrations of affection of the Athenians."
"It was late in the day before Perdita awoke, and a longer time elapsed before recovering from the torpor occasioned by the laudanum, she perceived her change of situation."
Never for one moment when most placid did I cease to pray for death.
"The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be."
"Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me."
"He received a letter from her to say that she was slightly ill, but telling him to hasten to her, that from his eyes she would receive health and that his company would be her surest medecine."
"I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation deep, dark, deathlike solitude."
"I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud."
When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.
The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self reproaches.
Its forest should be our world its garden afford us food; within its walls I would establish the shaken throne of health.
"'Pardon this intrusion,' said I; 'I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.' ""'Enter,' said De Lacey, 'and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.' ""'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.' ""I sat down, and a silence ensued."
"He transacted the business of the day apart from her; he went out, she knew not whither."
"During the first stage of the election, the Duke of had been thrown out; the question therefore lay between Lord Raymond and Mr. Ryland."
"That Raymond should marry Idris was more than ever intolerable; yet my passion, though a giant from its birth, was too strange, wild, and impracticable, for me to feel at once the misery I perceived in Perdita."
Again her chill limbs touched me as a torpedo; and I shuddered in sympathy with her pain and fright.
"You have often agreed with me that there is but one solution to the intricate riddle of life; to improve ourselves, and contribute to the happiness of others: and now, in the very prime of life, you desert your principles, and shut yourself up in useless solitude."
"Raymond had fought and conquered for the Athenians; he had suffered, on their account, peril, imprisonment, and hardship; their gratitude affected him deeply, and he inly vowed to unite his fate for ever to that of a people so enthusiastically devoted to him."
Even now if we had courage we might be free.
"This spirit existed as a breath, a wish, a far off thought, until communicated to Adrian, who imbibed it with ardour, and instantly engaged himself in plans for its execution."
"I gave to each heroine of whom I read, her beauty and matchless excellences such was Antigone, when she guided the blind Oedipus to the grove of the Eumenides, and discharged the funeral rites of Polynices; such was Miranda in the unvisited cave of Prospero; such Haidee, on the sands of the Ionian island."
"I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, ""Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin's to give an account of yourself."""
"The few jewels they had saved, supported them awhile."
Then on his word and will depended my own happiness the fate of all dear to me.
"Again her name was syllabled, and she shuddered as she asked herself, am I becoming mad, or am I dying, that I hear the voices of the departed?"
"The sight of her, in her present situation, passed like an arrow into his soul."
This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.
"""Do you not know, my friends,"" I said, ""that the Earl himself, now Lord Protector, visits daily, not only those probably infected by this disease, but the hospitals and pest houses, going near, and even touching the sick?"
"She seemed to be full of something to which she could not give words; but, seizing an opportunity afforded by Perdita's absence, she preferred to me an earnest prayer, that I would take her within view of the gate at which her father had entered Constantinople."
"Can I see George?"" ""See him,"" cried the woman, ""yes, if you go to him; last night he was taken with the plague, and we sent him to the hospital."""
"In solitude, and through many wanderings afar from the haunts of men, he matured his views for the reform of the English government, and the improvement of the people."
"If we went to Italy, to sacred and eternal Rome, we might with greater patience submit to the decree, which had laid her mighty towers low."
"I met troops of horses, herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, wandering at will; here throwing down a hay rick, and nestling from cold in its heart, which afforded them shelter and food there having taken possession of a vacant cottage."
But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.
"The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled."
"Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?"" ""Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred."
"I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin."
"The nature of Perdita was less perfect; but tenderness and happiness improved her temper, and softened her natural reserve."
I tried to soothe her; I bade her hope; I asked what tremendous consequences would ensue even on our failure.
"The mind of Raymond was not so rough cast, nor had been so rudely handled, in the circumstance of life, as to make him proof to these considerations on the contrary, he was all nerve; his spirit was as a pure fire, which fades and shrinks from every contagion of foul atmosphere: but now the contagion had become incorporated with its essence, and the change was the more painful."
"But pardon me, I entreat you and listen to me: do not turn away from me; do not be impatient; you may easily intimidate me into silence, but my heart is bursting, nor can I willingly consent to endure for one moment longer the agony of uncertitude which for the last four months has been my portion."
"Clara often accompanied him in these excursions; partly that she might see her parents, partly because Adrian delighted in the prattle, and intelligent looks of this lovely child."
"The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view."
My mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.
"I sought the hills; a west wind swept them, and the stars glittered above."
"But no care could re animate her, no medicine cause her dear eyes to open, and the blood to flow again from her pulseless heart."
"Alas ye were the last of happiness that I ever enjoyed; a few, a very few weeks and all was destroyed."
"Windsor is not my home; my true home I have found; the home that the Creator has prepared for me."""
"Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind."
"London, which had extended so far in suburbs in all direction, had been somewhat deserted in the midst, and much of what had in former days obscured this vast building was removed."
"Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her."
"Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature."
"I shall not pause in my exertions until that time; but, if plague revives with the coming year, all contest with her must cease, and our only occupation be the choice of a grave."""
We are said to love much those whom we greatly benefit.
Erringly and strangely she began the task of self examination with self condemnation.
On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.
"She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell."
"Now, at this evening hour, at the period of repose and refection, methinks all hearts breathe one hymn of love and thanksgiving, and we, like priests of old on the mountain tops, give a voice to their sentiment."
"It had been displayed early in life, leading her out to solitary musing among her native mountains, causing her to form innumerous combinations from common objects, giving strength to her perceptions, and swiftness to their arrangement."
I have detailed the perfections of my sister; and yet she was utterly unlike Idris.
"Her passions had subdued her appetites, even her natural wants; she slept little, and hardly ate at all; her body was evidently considered by her as a mere machine, whose health was necessary for the accomplishment of her schemes, but whose senses formed no part of her enjoyment."
"What are your plans, my Lord Protector, for the benefit of our country?"""
"Are you a coward, Woodville?"
"I do not say that if his own desires had been put in competition with those of others that he would have displayed undue selfishness, but this trial was never made."
"Soon our poor nurse expired; and the anguish of suspense was changed to deep regret, which though at first more painful, yet yielded with greater readiness to my consolations."
"""If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty."
A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.
"""Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger."
"Before, she had been visited by pangs of fear now, she never enjoyed an interval of hope."
Encourage the people by your presence.
"Once a writing of his fell into Perdita's hands; it was blotted with tears well might any blot it with the like ""Life"" it began thus ""is not the thing romance writers describe it; going through the measures of a dance, and after various evolutions arriving at a conclusion, when the dancers may sit down and repose."
"She seated herself then on the same ottoman where I had left her in the morning resting on the beating heart of her Raymond; I dared not approach her, but sat at a distant corner, watching her starting and nervous gestures."
We had entered the Castle.
I earned that; I deserved it.
He held out his hand with almost a bashful air.
"I then went to Idris, contriving in my way, plausible excuses for remaining all day in the Castle, and endeavouring to disperse the traces of care from my brow."
But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.
"He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own."
The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.
"I reproached myself bitterly for what I called a culpable weakness; but this weakness returned upon me whenever the critical moment approached, and I never found courage to depart."
This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.
"She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate."
"His rank his least merit, do you say?"
For many days Adrian and Idris continued to visit me thus.
"As it was, trembling, cold, and pale, she sought Raymond."
"""Pardon me,"" he replied, ""if I have offended."
"All this appeared to me, I own, methodized madness."
Would they refuse him?
"""Farewell I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold."
"Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships."
"When Raymond offered to clear her reputation, and demonstrate to the world her real patriotism, she declared that it was only through her present sufferings that she hoped for any relief to the stings of conscience; that, in her state of mind, diseased as he might think it, the necessity of occupation was salutary medicine; she ended by extorting a promise that for the space of one month he would refrain from the discussion of her interests, engaging after that time to yield in part to his wishes."
"Idris, you will not act the traitor towards me?"" ""Trust me,"" replied she, ""I will preserve a strict neutrality."""
You came the embodied image of my fondest dreams.
"Years hence we shall recount to them our fears, then passed away with their occasion."
Perdita smiled faintly her guest left her; the carriage rolling down the street assured the final departure.
"We were fatigued by our struggles to attain this point, and seated ourselves on the rocky couch, while the sounds of tinkling sheep bells, and shout of shepherd boy, reached us from above."
"Nobly and greatly, he said, had the illustrious and last sovereign of England sacrificed himself to the apparent good of his country, and divested himself of a power which could only be maintained by the blood of his subjects these subjects named so no more, these, his friends and equals, had in gratitude conferred certain favours and distinctions on him and his family for ever."
"""Oh, it is not thus not thus,"" interrupted the being."
"The curtain drew up, and the stage presented the scene of the witches' cave."
"My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert."
"so did he spring up from listlessness and unproductive thought, to the highest pitch of virtuous action."
"She thought of the treasure she possessed in the affections of her lord; of his accomplishments, surpassing those of his contemporaries, his genius, his devotion to her."
"To suspect evil, to perceive that, Alfred being with us, the danger must regard her youngest darling, to fly across the long chambers into his apartment, was the work but of a moment."
"And whether it were to visit beautiful scenery, or to see fine pictures, or sometimes for no object but to seek amusement as it might chance to arise, I was always happy when near my father."
"The dazzling sun and glare of daylight, deprived the scene of solemnity; from Evadne's low tomb, I joined Raymond and his staff, now on their way to the Golden City."
"A little patience, and all will be over; aye, a very little patience; for, look, there is the key of our prison; we hold it in our own hands, and are we more debased than slaves to cast it away and give ourselves up to voluntary bondage?"
"Adrian's chief endeavour, after the immediate succour of the sick, had been to disguise the symptoms and progress of the plague from the inhabitants of London."
She appeared of a different stock.
"I should there find solitude where I might weep, and the voices of life might never reach me."
"Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise."""
"August th, You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?"
"Tell me, however, in what way he passes his time; what he is doing and thinking in his cottage retreat?"" ""Nay, my sweet sister,"" replied Adrian, ""you ask me more than I can well answer; but if you feel interest in him, why not visit him?"
"She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire."
It were useless to record the debate that followed this harangue.
"Gasping, not daring to name our hopes, yet full even to the brim with intense expectation, we stood, as a ship wrecked sailor stands on a barren rock islanded by the ocean, watching a distant vessel, fancying that now it nears, and then again that it is bearing from sight."
"Although more than sixteen years had passed since her death nothing had been changed; her work box, her writing desk were still there and in her room a book lay open on the table as she had left it."
"His soul seemed to distil itself into the words he wrote; and they breathed on the paper, bearing with them a portion of the life of love, which was his life."
I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.
"On this occasion, my sister was not alone; nor could I fail to recognise her companion: it was Idris, the till now unseen object of my mad idolatry."
"I brought Rosalind and Miranda and the lady of Comus to life to be my companions, or on my isle acted over their parts imagining myself to be in their situations."
She was uncomplaining; but the very soul of fear had taken its seat in her heart.
"But I am about to die nay, interrupt me not soon I shall die."
And the remembrance fills your heart sometimes with bitter despair when otherwise your feelings would have melted into soft sorrow.
"She made it her task to attend the sick, comfort the sorrowing, assist the aged, and partake the sports and awaken the gaiety of the young."
"I would have prevented this; my death would be a small evil or rather I should not die; while you cannot hope to escape."""
"He hurried in, and witnessed the termination of my impassioned harangue."
"After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva."
"The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale."
Must he tax the landed interest to assist our commercial population?
"A bubbling spring prattles over stones on one side, and a plantation of a few elms and beeches, hardly deserve, and yet continue the name of wood."
In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
"One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race."
"This will I do, I said."
"Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed."
She pictured to herself the anguish of his solitude; she remembered with what eager delight he had in former days made her the partner of his joyful hopes with what grateful affection he received her sympathy in his cares.
"They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves."
But the task imposed on Perdita was not the less painful.
I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.
"Do not you desert me in the hour of trial' ""'Great God' exclaimed the old man."
Let him send me this regiment.
"He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain."
We feared the coming summer.
"Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life."
"His connection with Adrian and Perdita was never mentioned; he was to her a meteor, a companionless star, which at its appointed hour rose in her hemisphere, whose appearance brought felicity, and which, although it set, was never eclipsed."
I planned the whole scene with an earnest heart and franticly set my soul on this project.
"I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder."
He compared the royal and republican spirit; shewed how the one tended to enslave the minds of men; while all the institutions of the other served to raise even the meanest among us to something great and good.
"When I stood on my native hills, and saw plain and mountain stretch out to the utmost limits of my vision, speckled by the dwellings of my countrymen, and subdued to fertility by their labours, the earth's very centre was fixed for me in that spot, and the rest of her orb was as a fable, to have forgotten which would have cost neither my imagination nor understanding an effort."
I wait in quiet expectation for the closing hours of a life which has been to me most sweet bitter.
"You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend."
Sometimes she felt proud that he had preferred her to the hopes of a crown.
You grieve because you are unhappy; it is happiness you seek but you despair of obtaining it.
I shuddered; I dared not die even though the cold grave held all I loved; although I might say with Job Where is now my hope?
"More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?"
"She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes."
"He must aim no more at the dear object of his ambition; throwing his arms aside, he must for present ends give up the ultimate object of his endeavours."
"His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion."
"She heard that we were bound for Greece, that she would see her father, and now, for the first time, she prattled of him to her mother."
"But to lose all to lose with life and love, glory also It shall not be ""I, and in a few brief years, all you, this panic struck army, and all the population of fair Greece, will no longer be."
My soul was in tumults; I traversed the streets with eager rapidity.
"The misfortunes of Woodville were not of the hearts core like mine; his was a natural grief, not to destroy but to purify the heart and from which he might, when its shadow had passed from over him, shine forth brighter and happier than before."
Oh that I had words to express the luxury of death that I might win you.
"It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter."
"We, descendants from the one and the other, must be enemies also."
He was glorious from his youth.
"When they parted for the night, the Countess said, ""To morrow I trust your tone will be changed: be composed; I have agitated you; go to rest; and I will send you a medicine I always take when unduly restless it will give you a quiet night."""
"Do I fear, that my heart palpitates?"
"Either watching the crowd in the park, or occupied by painful reflection, we were all silent; Ryland stood by himself in an embrasure of the window; Adrian paced the hall, revolving some new and overpowering idea suddenly he stopped and said: ""I have long expected this; could we in reason expect that this island should be exempt from the universal visitation?"
"You will not do this, I know you will not."
"Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer."
"I am glad Woodville is not with me for perhaps he would grieve, and I desire to see smiles alone during the last scene of my life; when I last wrote to him I told him of my ill health but not of its mortal tendency, lest he should conceive it to be his duty to come to me for I fear lest the tears of friendship should destroy the blessed calm of my mind."
"They were men and women, the sufferers, before they were Mahometans, and when they rise turbanless from the grave, in what except their good or evil actions will they be the better or worse than we?"
"Yet such is human nature, that the excitement of mind was dear to me, and that the imagination, painter of tempest and earthquake, or, worse, the stormy and ruin fraught passions of man, softened my real sorrows and endless regrets, by clothing these fictitious ones in that ideality, which takes the mortal sting from pain."
"In the same way, individuals may escape ninety nine times, and receive the death blow at the hundredth; because bodies are sometimes in a state to reject the infection of malady, and at others, thirsty to imbibe it."
