1. Test Layer Parameters (Num layers first then shape)
2. Test optimal learning rate for different epoch intervals (5, 10, 20)
3. Test optimal batch size
One hot-encoding the inputs
Padding input sequences

Ideas:
Random author selection instead of just MWS to have a better nlp model
Basically just change the author every time from authors with similar amounts of training data
